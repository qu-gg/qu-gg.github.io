**Crash Landing** by One-Shot Wonders

#### **Adventure Description:** 
Being an globe-wide research organization, the Helical Archive has a decent fleet of Cloud Breaker skyships available to researchers and adventurers. During particularly busy times, however, they outsource to the Verdin Skyfarers Corporation out of Port Bevel for transportation. The party find themselves on one such flight, and are actively flying over the inhospitable Death Valley of No-Folk Land on their way to a research contract up north. A comfortable ride turns turbulent, however, when they crash land in the desert.

#### **Starting the Adventure:** 
*“You stand on the open deck of a Cloud Breaker, taking in the majestic views of the No-Folk Land barrens below. From this height, the cracks in the dry, mineral-rich earth create a fractal pattern, like an irregular mosaic. Suddenly, the ground begins racing towards you at speed, and you realize the ship is nose-diving out of the sky. Instincts kicking in, you clutch the railings and brace yourselves for impact.”*

There is little time for the party to react, so they cannot take actions that would slow or stop the skyship’s descent. 
Thankfully, the party land on shredded remains of the skyship's sails held aloft by the ship's shattered Floatstone. Each party member, as well as Captain Zero, immediately take a Light Injury. Wrought, the ship's first mate, is near death under rubble. Add to the jeopardy of the wait for rescue by requiring regular Grit Checks for heat exhaustion - inducing a roll on the Burn Injury Table. Each Grit Check requires a Ration (containing water), inducing a Snag on the Check if gone without.

#### **Suggested Story:**
1. Set the scene, describe the impact of the skyship and the aftermath of the crash, then continue:
2. **Brace for Impact:**
	1. As they stir, the party see Captain Zero looking for Wrought, who is buried under heavy debris.
	2. Wrought is Near Death [Source, pg. 260], dying in 2 Turns without help. He can only be partially healed to a Wounded state, as toxic fumes have damaged his lungs.
3. **Search for Supplies:**
	1. Zero asks the party to help her find the Transponder that she can use to signal for help. She also suggests they collect any useful survival gear.
	2. If the party make contact with the Verdin Corporation relay, they are told a rescue ship won’t be able to attend until the next morning, due to extreme winds.
4. **Head for Shelter:**
	1. Zero says it is unwise to stay at the crash site, due to the weather and the threat of colossal beasts or warlord clans.
	2. The party find some ancient ruins to shelter under, but during the night, a Railgun Shrimp burrows up out of the sand and attack the party. The party may become further Fatigued due to interrupted sleep.
5. **Exhausting Morning**:
	1. The next morning, the party travel back to the crash site, but are caught in a sandstorm. It is caused by two raging Ghost Peppers and three Dust Mephits who attack the party.
	2. Once the spirits are defeated, the rescue ship appears. The party must signal to it, before being picked up and taken to their destination. Zero’s boss congratulates the party on their survival.

#### **Important Characters:**
**PILOT "Zero" Mk.0**
*Bio-Mechanoid, female, ??? ()*
Recently re-awoken from a Manathene facility in Stahlfeld, Zero discovered an affinity for piloting and has recently been accepted as a captain for the Verdin Fleet.
***“Zero's flight suit has been shredded by the impact of the crash, but her uncracked neon eye remains alert.”***

**Wrought Mutton**
*Dwarf, male, 85 (Scholar)*
A very craggly and cracked Dwarf, Wrought has an unbeatable, calm attitude. He handles the ship maintenance and navigation among other duties.
***“Wrought lies in the wreckage, limbs awkwardly trapped under rubble. His broad stone chest lies still and his mossy beard is starting to wither in the searing heat.”***

#### **Key Locations:**
**Crash Site**
***"Scattered around you are smoldering chunks of wooden decking, hull and rigging. The terrifying sounds of a malfunctioning Spell Engine whirs near you. The debris has kicked up plumes of dust that clog your throat."***
Among the debris, the party can easily find three surviving rations, and two Extreme Heat Outfits. The others burned during the engine explosion.

The emergency Transponder Zero is looking fro has been thrown away from the ship and is partially buried in the sand.

**Akenian Ruins**
***"“The crash site rests next to an ancient, sandblasted road. Up its path lie some ancient ruins of a long-past outpost, sheltered from the sun and winds."***
Learned characters might identify these ruins as belonging to Akenia and holding inscribings/teachings about the Invincible Bright...and how to manipulate it. Mostly picked clean and derelict, however a long-buried and tattered **Glide Mantle** can be found near the inscribings.

Unfortunately for the party, this is the home lair of a Railgun Shrimp. During their rest, it will attempt to Ambush the party, targeting those with metallic equipment fist.

**Desert Surroundings**
***"The dry air makes your eyes sting and you quickly become as parched as the hard ground beneath your tired feet."***
With no night to fall and beaming light filtering in the ruin's ceiling, sleep is difficult and painful.  During the morning sandstorm, visibility is severely reduced and the party stumble directly into the path of the raging Ghost Peppers and the swirling Dust Mephits.

#### Secrets and Clues
1. Thanks to the colossal creatures that feed and roam freely in the region, No-Folk Land is regarded as an inhospitable place. Only the crazed attempt life here.
2. Verdin Skyfarer Corporation is only one of two companies offering crossings over No-Folk Land; the other being Nyanko Aeronomics. They both have stellar safety records.
3. As Cloud Breaker travel is reserved for those with connections or the wealthy, most travelers brave No-Folk Land with local guides that know highly-secretive caravan routes.
4. Zero's partner, T34 or "Tea", worries about the dangers of flying and has asked her to get a new job. Unfortunately, Zero suspects she has a literal designed love for it.
5. Investigating the wreckage reveals that a Cinder Mephit in the engine caused it to overheat.
6. The Spell Engine powering the ship has exploded, and is damaged far beyond repair.
7. Wrought was standing near the Spell Engine when the skyship crashed, so he inhaled a lot of toxic Mana.
8. The ship's first-aid kit was damaged on pact, destroying the precious Basic Potions and Sun Balms stored within.
9. If the party can't call for help, Zero deduces a ship will be sent when they don't arrive on time though that could be multiple days.
10. Vichar Verdin is the head of the Verdin Skyfarer Corporation and has made a killing on contracting out to Helical.

#### Quest Resolution
**Rewards:** After the rescue, Vichar Verdin himself will meet the party at their destination, offering them a compensation of 500C and a first-class flight to anywhere in the Outer World. If they survive, Zero and Wrought thank the party profusely for their aid.
