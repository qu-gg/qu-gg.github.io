#### **Adventure Description:** 
As poachers close in on an expectant Prism Rokko-Do mother, a passionate conservationist will do everything in his power to protect the animal and her unborn chicks. That includes hiring the party to travel with him to the frozen tundra and keep watch during the laid eggs.

#### **Starting the Adventure:** 
*“You accepted a bodyguard job at the Archive that offered the chance to explore the frozen tundras of the Seven Holy Isles. A specialist within the Helical Conservation Society, or HCS, is offering decent pay to protect him as he patrols the frozen fields between the Winding Pass. Your contact is named Tumble Treks, a conservationist stationed at the arctic checkpoint you’re currently heading to. The trek so far hasn’t been easy, and the weather has been anything but predictable. As another blizzard closes in, you spot a hut with a steaming chimney bearing the HCS emblem, and make your way there.”*

Tumble spotted a heavily pregnant Prism Rokko-Do on a recent patrol, and believes it is likely that she will lay eggs within the next few days. He hopes to observe the labour of the endangered creature and protect it until it regains strength. As the arctic fields can be dangerous, he spent some of the HCS quarterly budget on bodyguards for his self-led mission.

#### **Suggested Story:**
1. Set the scene, have the party enter the hut, let Cara and Tumble greet everyone, then continue:
2. **No Time to Lose**
	1. As Tumble explains his plans, Cara asks where he will camp, in case she needs to send help.
	2. Tumble guides the party on a trek into the arctic fields towards an icy lake, a few miles to the north, which takes a Day's Travel. You might introduce Journey mechanics here if desired (Tumble acts as a Guide). 
	3. The Party may Camp and partake in Camping Activities. Good time to check if they bought Rations!
3. **Polar Panic:**
	1. A Polar Bear is found in a trap near the lake. The party must help Tumble release the trap, stop the bleeding and stitch the wounds. The creature loses 1 Heart with every failed attempt to save it, and its survival depends on the party’s success. Examples: Aura Check to calm the creature, Might Check to loosen the trap, Insight Check (by Tumble or PC w/ relevant Ability at an Edge).
	2. The group must cross the frozen lake to continue, which takes another Day's Travel.
4. **Birthing Pains:**
	1. During the third day of travel, Tumble spots the Prism Rokko-Do mother near a rocky alcove. He sets up his tent, gets out his field kit and approaches cautiously to assist. The mother gives lays two healthy-looking prism eggs.
	2. Keeping their identities concealed, Cara, Roh and another Mutt poacher fly to the alcove riding a Giant Fluffed Skree. They demand the cubs, and will fight for them.
	3. The poachers focus on stealing the cubs and putting them in a cage strapped to the Giant Owl. If they succeed, the poachers will try to escape.
	4. If badly wounded, Cara confesses and apologizes. Furious, Tumble leaves her fate to the party.
	5. With the poachers defeated, Tumble and the party watch over the mother and cubs until dawn.

#### **Important Characters:**
**Tumble Treks**
*Chib, Male, 41 (Guide)*
A conservationist who specializes in arctic animal welfare and has a passion for Rokko-Dos.
***"Only Tumble’s rosy cheeks and bright smile are visible underneath the woolly, HCS-branded anorak and hood that keeps him warm."***

**Careaway "Cara" Solis**
*Mundymutt, Female, 24 (Proudhound Sellsword)*
A criminal who is masquerading as a conservationist; Cara is part of a gang of organised poachers.
***“A bottle of animal milk and small packs of bird seed are held in Cara’s HCS cargo jacket. Cocky and self-assured in her duties.”***

**Ruh "Roh"**
*Mundymutt, Male, 20 (Blaster Mage)*
Roh sees animals, especially rare ones, as valuable commodities. He follows Cara’s orders.
***“Roh’s armor is faux-flamboyant and trimmed with crimson fur. His wicked, frostbitten muzzle is full of sharp teeth that he regularly bares in anger or bravado.”***

#### **Key Locations:**
**Conservation Hut**
***"A stoked fireplace keeps this narrow, stone lodge warm. Its walls and tables are covered in annotated maps, anatomical drawings of animals, and books filled with biological essays."***
This hut is one of many NCS sites scattered throughout the realm; each serves as a secure base of operations for its conservationists. Cara and Tumble sleep on bunk beds in a cramped box room.

**Lake of Broken Ice**
***"Large chunks of snow-covered, cracked ice make a twisting path across a frozen lake ahead. The footprints of animals who have utilized this temporary route are dotted through the snow."***
This large lake freezes and thaws at different points of the year.  Anyone attempting to cross the lake will need to keep their balance on the ice, or risk falling and suffering damage from the cold waters below (CLICK! Pit Trap).

**Rocky Alcove**
***"Against the rugged, frozen cliffs, a shallow alcove offers protection from the bitterly cold wind and weather. Small weeds cling to its grey walls, benefiting from the shelter."***
The respite from the elements makes this alcove the obvious choice for the Prism Rokko-Do mother to lay her eggs. The poachers can be spotted circling the skies above this area.

#### Secrets and Clues
1. Tumble has worked with Cara for a year; the two have become friends, and he respects her insight
2. By leaking key breeding and nesting sites to Roh, Cara has made them both a lot of money.
3. Prism Rokko-Do are endangered because they are poached for their iridescent plumage which contains an essence that can accelerate one's movement.
4. Roh has set up bear traps around the lake, in an attempt to gather expensive Polar Bear fur.
5. Roh’s snow-coloured Giant Fluffed Skree wears a spiked collar, and has been treated harshly by him.
6. Cara’s gang are the only poachers in the area, but have caused the HCS major issues.

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1-10  | No Encounter. A snow mound falsely shifts, a chunk of ice falls, a harmless creature gallops past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 11-14 | Butchered Remains: The carcass of some creature hastily butchered by poachers is left in crimson snow. Tumble will take the time to bury it, solemnly explaining how much of a problem these poacher gangs have been and how well they've eluded tracking.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 15-18 | A Sweet Bite: 6x Peppermint Lalka<br>Situation: No one knows who created these sweet demons but in the frozen wastes around the Outer World they are a common nuisance. Unfortunately, this lot has taken an interest in you.<br>Consequence: Armor Crash injuries taken from a Peppermint Lalka ruptures Extreme Cold Outfits, exposing the wearer to the extreme cold. Grit Check/Day's Travel or Fatigue. |
| 18-20 | Yeeti Pack: 3x Yeetis<br>Situation:  Thought to have formed tribal society in the Isles tundras, the HCS has in-so-far been unable to observe these giants closely on account of their hostility and ability to throw shockingly large objects very far distances.<br>Consequences: If unnoticed, Yeetis will start the fight with throwing rocks (CLICK! Falling Debris) and then engaging in combat.       |
**Locations:**
1. **Conservation Hut**: This hut is one of many NCS sites scattered throughout the realm; each serves as a secure base of operations for its conservationists. Cara and Tumble sleep on bunk beds in a cramped box room.
2. **Lake of Broken Ice** [Trap]: This large lake freezes and thaws at different points of the year.  Anyone attempting to cross the lake will need to keep their balance on the ice, or risk falling and suffering damage from the cold waters below (CLICK! Pit Trap).
3. **Rocky Alcove** [Guardian Encounter]: The respite from the elements makes this alcove the obvious choice for the Prism Rokko-Do mother to lay her eggs. The poachers can be spotted circling the skies above this area.

#### Quest Resolution
**Fighting:** Cara considers this her finest catch yet and is willing to throw away her "in" at the HCS for this haul - 2 fresh Prism Eggs are prime capital. As such, she'll betray Roh and the other Mutt, leaving by herself if they manage to strap the eggs on. The failure case for the party (and perhaps the start of future adventure) is if Cara manages to take the Flee Action with the Prism Eggs strapped on.  If badly wounded, Cara will confess and apologize. Furious, Tumble leaves the poacher's fate to the party.

**Rewards:** Tumble has set aside 100C from his HCS budget to pay the party. Thankful for the protection, the  astute mother Rokko-Do will willingly give up 2 Prism Feathers [Source, pg. 292] to the party. Roh has a small satchel with 1 Unit of Pilose Bumpo Fleece [Source, pg. 290] and 2 Rations. To be particularly nice, there is a Giant Fluffed Skree ready as a potential mount if the party calms it :)
