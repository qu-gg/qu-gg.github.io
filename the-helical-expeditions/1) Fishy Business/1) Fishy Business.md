**Fishy Business** by One-Shot Wonders

#### **Adventure Description:** 
A meal at the most popular dining spot in town takes a bizarre turn when the chef reports that his ingredients have started fighting back. Plucky diners must intervene to stop the chaos that ensues, before finding the magical source of this aquatic anomaly. 

#### **Starting the Adventure:** 
*"Set atop the exposed skyscraper rooftop and floors of the submerged, lost city Dia sits the research-outpost-turned-town of X where Helical researchers and adventurers prepare before diving into the metropolitan depths below in search of treasure or answers, just like you. Pockets of exposed building-tops make up a patchwork town where the primary means of travel are rafts...or swimming. Supporting these trailblazers are outcasts gathered to build a new life at the frontiers, one of whose glowing reviews of fried fish fritters, hearty chowder, and various seafood delights have drawn you to book a tab at their establishment, Diver's Rest."* 

As the party sits down, they have their orders taken and are told by Trina will be delayed due to a late delivery of today's catch. Unknown to the diners, Trina is angry that her family's Surf-n-Turf went bust after Thwak's opened. She has hired a Sea Witch to ruin Thwak's business. The Sea Witch has transformed Thwak's trusted anglers into seafood, in an attempt to drive away his loyal customers.

#### **Suggested Story:**
1. Set the scene, describe the Diver's Rest, have Tara take the player's orders, then continue.
2. **Today's Special:**
	1. While the party are waiting for their lunch, Thwak bursts out of the kitchen screaming, claiming his ingredients are possessed. 
	2. Three Octopuses and 4 Giant Crabs are close behind Thwak. The creatures begin causing damage and attacking diners. They must be stopped!
3. **Creature Containment:**
	1. If any of the creatures are knocked out/dispatched, they turn straight back into an angler from the *Sandpiper*. Otherwise, they turn back after 10 minutes.
	2. The anglers (if alive) are dazed, but remember a hooded figure on board their ship and a flash of sickly green light. Thwak hires the party to investigate the ship to find out the source of this cursed catch, while he deals with angry diners demanding refunds.
4. **Trawl for Clues:**
	1. The *Sandpiper* is moored in *Angler's Cove*. Friss and her minions have turned the ship into a horrid lair and can be found lurking in the boat's damp hold.
	2. Ways to resolve the adventure vary depending on the party's intentions.

#### **Important Characters:**
**Thwak**
*Goblin, Male, 22 (Commoner)*
A determined and skilled young chef. He is very sharp, and has big plans for his new business.
***"Thwak wears a spotless white apron and chef's hat, and moves at a frenetic pace. His fingers often fidget while he dreams up new meals."***

**Tara Tippytop**
*Chib, Female, 40 (Commoner)*
The Diver's End waiter. She has years of experience from working in her family's now-closed surf-n-turf joint.
***"Tara balances items on her silver platter with easy grace though she has bags under her eyes. Her red hair is neatly pinned back."***

**Friss Coveheart**
*Sea Witch, Female, ??? (Sea Witch)*
Given the chance, she relishes in making other people suffer. She travels with 4 Hopper Majos and 2 Naiads.
***"Long, oily seaweed falls in waves around Friss's face, where a blue tinge is noticeable in her skin. A deep irritation and loathing swirls in her eyes."***

#### **Key Locations:**
**Diver's Rest**
***"A former rooftop bar, the rough, white walls of this eatery are still decorated with ancient Gleysian paraphernalia."***
Delicious smells drift from a tiny, cramped kitchen, accessible by a serving hatch and a narrow door. The simple covered outdoor dining spot only has a dozen finely decorated tables. A long and winding queue often forms on rafts out in the water, full of potential patrons hoping to book a table.

**Deck of the *Sandpiper***
***"The crimson boat appears sturdy and has plenty of nets and fishing equipment visible on deck."***
The *Sandpiper* is rather difficult to locate among the ruined, as it is moored on the far side of *Angler's Cove*, towards a dangerous crumbled section. Loud sounds or vibrations cause Falling Debris (using the [CLICK!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1359104566414807231/1359104566586642582/image.png?ex=6945ca03&is=69447883&hm=52bba3ec5fa9e4fdf811260acf03505e944174a1aa312be84599d0724f63129b) Homebrew).

The ship is eerily quiet and the acrid stench of the Sea Witch lingers on board. A trail of filthy brine and pieces of rotten seaweed can be found on deck, leading to the hold below.

**The *Sandpiper's* Hold**
***"Muddy water coats the walls and forms puddles on the dirty, wooden floor. Barnacles and seaweed seem to have quickly claimed the interior of this once tidy vessel."***
The boat's new residents have littered the interior with magical traps, fish bones, and slimy kelp. Friss's minions (2 packs of 2 Hopper Majo x 1 Naiad) are scouring the deck/hold for valuables, and will attack if discovered.

**Minor Locations**
1. **Diver's Guild:** Helical branch dedicated to aiding researchers/adventurers in their dives. Sell nautical equipment.
2. **Tea's Ferry:** A [Neriedian](https://breakrpg.blogspot.com/2024/09/freebie-surf-and-turf-gaddabovids-and.html) who offers a ferry service around X, often sat around Diver's Rest. 5 stone/ride.
3. **Angler's Cove:** A covered mooring spot for all non-Helical boats, set within the upper floor a building (think parking garage if it were the top floor of a skyscraper).

#### Secrets and Clues
1. Thwak is new to X. He was raised in Portia and trained as a chef in its bustling docks.
2. Not but a few dives ago, which are regularly scheduled, Thwak received a threatening note warning him to close his business.
3. Thwak angler's have been fishing within Friss's cove (likely unknowingly), disrupting the delicate (and delicious) ecosystem she's cultivated for decades.
4. Friss prefers indirect action and was amused that Tara was willing to strike a deal. In exchange for helping Tara ruin the Diver's Rest, Tara promised to XXXX
5. As a child in the Galvanus Archipelago, Tara was told cautionary tales of those who made deals with Sea Witches.
6. A suspicious figure has been lurking around *Angler's Cove*, asking who supplies Thwak's seafood.
7. Friss used her cursed baubles to turn the anglers into seafood and delivered them to Thwak's restaurant.
8. Tara had no idea the methods that Friss would use to ruin the Diver's End reputation.
9. The anglers of the *Sandpiper* only fish for Thwak. He pays them well for their exquisite seafood.
10. The Diver's Rest is in a bid to host the Helical's leader Plum before the next dive; any bad press could ruin its chances.

#### Quest Resolution
**Fighting:** If the party decides to take out Friss, they'll easily find a contract signed by Tara. The contract details the deal between them that Tara would XXXX in exchange for the demise of Diver's Rest. If the party returns to Diver's Rest and confronts Tara, she'll break down and beg Thwak for forgiveness. Betrayed, Thwak will leave Tara's fate up to the party.

The party can take Friss's *Cracked Fish Eye Jar* bauble, though it cracked during the fight and only has one use left. She is also wearing a pouch of 4 Trapped Song pearls (Source Book, pg. 293) around her neck. Thwak will gift the party free meals during their stay and 200C for solving the mystery.

**Negotiation with Friss:** If the party sympathizes with Friss's irritation at the disruption of her cove's ecosystem, she might be willing to Negotiate rather than fight. If the party can convince Thwak and the anglers to shift their fishing grounds elsewhere (which Thwak will be desperately against given his food's reputation relies on it), then Friss will release the *Sandpiper* and goes back to her waters.

As a token of appreciation, Friss will offer up one of her baubles - her *Sinew Fishing Line* (1 Slot | 100C), allowing the party to cast her *Fishing Lines* Ability 3 times before the line runs out. On outstanding Negotiation/resolution, the party might gain a favor from the Sea Witch or even a Social Bond.
