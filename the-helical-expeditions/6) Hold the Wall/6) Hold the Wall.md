#### **Adventure Description:** 
Aiden's Wall has stood for centuries against the Hollow Queen's hordes, unwavering. However, when a routine inspection of its Spell Engines showed it beginning to fail, an emergency task force is gathered. The party must take a stand alongside The Red Blades against the "children" of the Queen, while quick efforts are made to secure the wall.
#### **Starting the Adventure:** 
*"The severity of the situation is etched in the hardened faces of the upper-ranking Red Blades you pass in the wall's top corridors. Rugged and frosted windows give you the faintest view over the desolate tundra beyond the wall where twisted cities and demonic forces lie in the mist. The weight of Aiden's task falls on you as you stand atop this miles-long, cold-iron wall - ever buzzing with the churn of the Mana Barrier engines below. As the briefing room doors open, you see Commander Vashaan, as cold as the stone beneath her, leaning over an arcane device.*

The party might question why they are there. As it is a high-ranking adventure, maybe they were noted in the area and asked to aid directly. Or were even the ones that discovered the failing engines, on behalf of the Helical Archive. Make the Red Blades formidable and scary but equally match respect for the party. Try to make Juk's Sunblade something for the party to protect alongside the Wall, as it holds back lesser demons from their combat area.

#### **Suggested Story:**
1. Set the scene, have the party shown into the strategy chamber to speak with the Commander, then continue:
2. **Sputtering Engines:**
	1. Vashaan instructs the party to assist the special forces while the six Massive Spell Engines within the wall undergo repairs. The deactivation of the Mana Barrier will certainly attract a powerful horde, and the wall must be defended while it is vulnerable.
	2. She introduces Captain Juk as their envoy and to protect the Sunblade dearly.
3. **Descent:**
	1. Commander Vashaan escorts the party to an massive grated elevator, noting that its function will cut out while the Engines are being repaired. Below stands 5 Squads of Red Blades.
	2. The elevator lands, the buzz of the Engines cease, and thundering footsteps approach. From the mist, the party faces a Shadow Sorceress with 6 Malignant Echos. 
	3. At all times, dozens of Blighted Demons are 1 Area outside combat - kept back by Juk's Sunblade.
4. **Standing Ground:**
	1. As the hordes advance, they are clustered around siege-breaking colossi called Marbled Gohma. The Squads split to tackle one each, including one left for the party. It will take 10 Turns before the Engines are repaired.
	2. Every 2 Turns, roll a D20 for each Squad where 10+ means Success. A Squad's outcome depends on it hitting 3 Successes or Failures first. PCs can aid other Squads with Abilities/Actions to give the roll an Edge. Failed Squads reduce the Wall's Hearts by 2.
	3. After 10 Turns, the buzz of the Engines resume and the Wall light once more. The lifts will raise in 2 more Turns so the party must go!

#### **Important Characters:**
**Commander Vashaan**
*Elf, Female, 45 (Oppressor)*
Commander of the Red Blades, this fearsome and ruthless sentinel has stood against the horde since the Calamity itself.
***"Donning the most wicked crimson Superheavy Armor in the Outer World, it'd be easy to mistake Vashaan as the conqueror were tables turned."***

**Captain Juk**
*Tenebrate, Male, 32 (Proudhound)*
Captain Juk has been assigned as the Star Gem Bearer for the party's mission. 
***"Not a hair is out of place on the Captain's crimson uniform. Resolute determination is all on his face, staring over the wall."***

#### **Key Locations:**
**Briefing Room**
***"A wall of ruined blades adorns the wall of this place, likely belonging to lost Blades. A simple Star Gem embedded in the ceiling provides warmth against the frost."***
Brutalist and practical, this briefing room holds an arcane device in the center, showcasing concentrations of Dark Mana within a wide range of the wall. While the wall itself is clear as yet, signs of forces building in the nearby City of Corpses has Vashaan on edge.

**The Red Wall**
***"One could only assume it is made entirely of Shade Iron by how ominous this massive plated wall looks set against frozen mountains."***
The wall has a Defense Rating of 20 and 20 Hearts. Its Massive Spell Engines emit enough Bright Mana to ward off the Hollow Queen's children, however they must be deactivated to carry out repairs.

Unfortunately for the defense force, it also powers the lifts which means that there is no escape until the repairs are complete...or the wall falls.

#### Secrets and Clues
1. Vashaan has made contingency plans for evacuation with nearby settlements prepared to leave on notice. However, she believes many would not outpace the horde.
2. A recent inner-rank betrayal by one of 'Her Beloved' has left the Red Blades lacking in numbers.
3. Each squad has a dedicated Star Gem Bearer within the Red Blades, spaced out as they are due to scarcity of the gems.
4. The Massive Spell Engines were repurposed from Akenia, and only the greatest magitech engineers can repair it.
5. The City of Corpses, Cauldron, was once the forward operating ground of the Red Blades before being wiped out early in the 4th Aeon.
6. Star Gem Bearers are a necessary role, as without them, the hordes of lesser demons would overrun even the greatest warrior.

#### Quest Resolution
**Rewards:** On success, Sunblade is offered to the party, a treasured blade reserved for the highest ranks of the Red Blades. Free quarters and meals are provided for as long as the party stays.

Outstanding success (all Squads saved) will result in Vashaan offering the party a Red Blades Insignia, a powerful icon of status throughout the Wistful Dark.

**Sunblade** [Master Weapon] - made of Sun Gold, absorbs sunlight (including from a Star Shard), storing up to a week’s worth while unsheathed, can then emit sunlight as like a _Star Gem._ Can expel all stored up sunlight to deal 1 additional Damage (minimum 1 day stored). 1 Slot | 4 Gems
