#### **Adventure Description:** 
When a beloved tavern owner's daughter goes missing, he entrusts the party with the ransom money that has been demanded by a group of hostage takers. The party should expect dangerous dealings in dangerous sands, because the double-crossing drama doesn't end with a simple swap.
#### **Starting the Adventure:** 
*"Prickly's Rest & Recovery settlement has been a centuries-long staple on the path between the Sol Alliance and the Thunda Sands, passed down through generations. Every traveler or merchant ensures a stop there for their thirst-quenching drinks and world-renowned acupuncture treatments. Word has reached far that the assumed heir to the R&R, Senita Prickly, has been taken hostage a few days ago. Passing through the area yourselves, and having stopped for a drink, you've offered your aid to the proprietor, Pinta Prickly."*

With a relatively simple structure, feel free to add more into this adventure. Add an Encounter Table/Trap on the Journey there or take some more time exploring the R&R and introducing merchants/GMCs worried about Senita.

#### **Suggested Story:**
1. Set the scene, introduce Pinta, then continue.
2. **Taken for a Ride:**
	1. Pinta shares the random note, which says the swap will take place in the ruins of a gladiatorial arena nearby. He wants Senita rescued, and to find out who took her.
	2. On foot in the sands, the Journey would take 3 Days and is very dangerous due to heat. Pinta gives the party Sandy Mokko-Dos to ride to the arena, cutting it down to 2 Travel Days and 1 Night of Camping.
		1. Every Day traveled requires a Grit Check against the heat or gain a Fatigue. Extreme Heat Outfits or similar ignores this.
	3. A local Guide named Pincushion is resting at the R&R. He could be convinced or paid to help the party. Pincushion can Trailblaze the Journey with a Major Bonus.
3. **Arena Ambush:**
	1. The party must place the ransom in the arena, then wait. Soon after, 5 Thunda Barbarians appear on Mokko-Dos alongside Arie and Senita on a Rokko-Do.
	2. As Senita walks across the arena "freed", a Barbarian fires at a Trap above the party; heavy jars come smashing down, revealing 3 Mud and 3 Wind Lalkas that attack.
	3. Simultaneously, a Snare Trap (CLICK!) goes off as rope beneath the party snaps taut as the jars fall down.
4. **Mokko-Do Chase:**
	1. In the chaos, Senita grabs the money, jumps onto Arie's Rokko-Do, and rides off with the Barbarians.
	2. The party must give chase on their mounts and fight the Barbarians. When the Barbarians suffer 3 losses, Senita yells to stop the fight and admits she is in on the plot. She returns the money, along with a note for Pinta.
	3. Relived Senita is well (if still worried), Pinta rewards the party.

#### **Important Characters:**
**Pinta Prickly**
*Pricklefolk, Male, 96 (Basic Folk)*
Proprietor of Prickly's R&R, he's been running the show for over 50 years. Above all, though,  he values his daughter's happiness.
***"A rotund pricklefolk with a neat mustache, a large hat, and the creases of a lifetime of smiles, he is anything but jovial as he desperately asks for help."***

**Senita Prickly**
*Pricklefolk, Female, 61 (Custrel)*
Adventurous Senita believes that Pinta won't support her desire to travel the world before settling down.
***"Dressed in both the finest weaves of the Blazing Gardens and wild Barbarian armors, Senita has a fire in her eyes when speaking about the world."***

**Pincushion**
*Pricklefolk, Male, 155 (Guide)*
Pincushion is a well-known Guide in the Cereus Plateau, but claims himself retired and "not taking another step in those blasted sands". He can be convinced or compensated well for "one last trip".
**"Grizzled with broken needles and a glare sharper than any thorn, Pincushion sits at the bar with arms crossed and wide hat tilted down."**

**Arie Pryn**
*Promethean, Female, 34 (Thunda Captain)*
Arie is the leader of a Clan of Thunda Barbarians who respect freedom and travel above all else. She poses as the hostage taker.
**"An imposing Promethean Barbarian who commands the respect of her Clan, she sits high atop a dangerous Rokko-Do."**

#### **Key Locations:**
**Prickly's R&R**
***"Welcome to Prickly Tavern! Don't worry, the drinks are sharp but they sure ain't pointy."***
Prickly's R&R acts as a Luxurious Suite, offering Hearty Meals and Excellent Service [Source pg. 201]. The party might acquire Cac-tails (cactus cocktails) that act as temporary Extreme Heat Outfits for 5C, and various wares for travel.

**The Anyder Amphitheater**
***"All that remains of this once grand exhibition of humanity's greatest creations (and their immediate defeat in combat) are dusty ruins."***
Partially buried in the sands from time, this derelict amphitheater is the perfect spot for an ominous random trade. Alcoves of shade from rubble create many areas to ambush from, and there are multiple entrances into it.

#### Secrets and Clues
1. These Thunda Barbarians are part of a freedom-loving Clan and were enamored with Senita's dreams to see the world. Feel free to break out into a musical number "She Has a Dream!"
2. Senita has been working with her father at the R&R for 50 years, and feels pressure to step up and run the business "soon".
3. Arie suggested the hostage scheme to give Senita a reason to disappear, and some funds for her trip.
4. Senita's note to Pinta explains that she intends to return to the R&R in a year's time, after seeing the Blazing Gardens.
5. Pincushion may have a thorny exterior but is actually a big softie. He feels a desire to go help save Senita so it won't take much convincing to get him to "un"-retire.
6. The gladiatorial arena is the ruins of an ancient amphitheater during the 2nd Aeon used as a way to pit the most elite warriors against strange engineered creatures.
7. The arena, if investigated, has busted and buried motifs depicting great workings of Mana and the Invincible Bright.

#### Quest Resolution
**Rewards:** Pinta will give the party the **Rokko-Lasso** and 50C, and offer them complimentary acupuncture treatment and drinks [Hearty Meal + Excellent Service. Source pg. 201].

If the party makes friends with Pincushion (e.g. Socialization during Camping), he will gift them his pair of lucky boots [Galvani's Boots] as he retires "for real this time".

**Rokko-Lasso** [Lash Weapon + Utility] 
*Beloved tool of Rokko-Do Tamers within the Thunda Sands.* 
Grants a Minor Bonus to Combat Tricks or Attacks Stunts attempting to pull or restrain a target. 1 Slot. 50C. Made by Yan Kodiac.

**Galvani's Boots**
*These simple leather boots always seem to fit whoever tries to wear them. They were said to have belonged to Galvani, the first person to travel the whole of the Outer World.*
Wearing these boots allows you to act as a Guide during a journey. If you are already able to act as a Guide, you instead gain a Major (+4) Bonus on Insight Rolls to Trailblaze.
