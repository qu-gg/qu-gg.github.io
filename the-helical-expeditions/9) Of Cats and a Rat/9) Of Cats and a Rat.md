**Clan Members:** Reflavored Mundymutts, Source pg. 400

#### **Adventure Description:** 
The gig? Simple. Head to the Nyanko alleyways, hand off a token, and receive a bag of Puretech Salvage. Despite the simple task completed, things go south for the party when their rendezvous point with their contractor gets busted...while they're there! The party must escape through the city sewers and make it to a safehouse, unnoticed.

#### **Starting the Adventure:** 
*"Whatever your personal reason - greed, belief, thrill - dealing with the Seeing Eyes Clan of Nyanko is dangerous business. A criminal organization set in the shadows of the sun-bathed Pride Coast capital, they seek to undermine the brutal Startech Technocracy by smuggling and distributing Puretech on the streets. You've accepted a simple gig to prove your worth - meet at a drop-off point, trade a token for a bag of Puretech Salvage, and bring it to a warehouse far side of town."*

This adventure is primarily focused around three components of BREAK!! - Negotiation, Combat, and Exploration. Stealth or social characters would do wonders in this story, while still having room for combat characters in the mid-section.

#### **Suggested Story:**
1. Set the scene of the Drop Site, describe Runt, then continue.
2. **An Unlikely Collaboration:**
	1. Unexpectedly, the Puretech dealer is a Mundymutt named Runt. He is skittish, and suspects foul-play when the party shows for the deal instead of a Clan member.
	2. Runt will initially refuse to hand over the Puretech despite their token. Successful Negotiation is needed for him to hand it over peacefully. 
	3. If Negotiation fails, Runt will initiate Combat with a Grenade before attempting to Flee the next Turn. He is a Basic Folk and very easy to stop.
3. **The Hit:**
	1. The party heads back towards the warehouse, and has to avert the attention of any Peacekeepers patrolling. Require Stealth here, if desired.
	2. On arrival, a few Clan members are present with the leader being Anubis to take the Salvage directly. As the deal goes on, however, 12 Peacekeepers burst through the windows, engaging.
	3. In the aftermath, Anubis offers the party to retreat with them into the sewer-ways to a Safehouse to lay low. 
	4. Runt can be found bound outside, shown to be the "rat" that tipped the warehouse, and will beg for life.
4. **The Sewer Express:**
	1. The party makes it into the sewer-ways and have to navigate them to the Safehouse [Adventure Site]. Unfortunately, alerted Peacekeepers are patrolling the sewer-ways. The party can stealth through or fight through.
	2. The Safehouse is the back chambers of a sushi house on the docks. Anubis promises to provide safe passage out of Nyanko if desired but, for now, they may lay low and enjoy some sushi.

#### **Important Characters:**
**Golden "Anubis" Eyes**
*Rai-Neko, Male, 34 (Proudhound)*
Significant figure in the Seeing Eye Clan of Nyanko. A terrifying presence by the simple directness in orders, and lethal golden eyes.
***"A sphinx cat dressed in a non-descript suit but covered full-body in tattoos, it is said his menacing glance alone can stop a man's heart."***

**"Just Runt"**
*Mundymutt, Male, 25 (Basic Folk)*
A representative of the Ruff Riders, sent to infiltrate Nyanko as a dealer of Puretech Salvage. Very skittish and distrusting.
***"With a demeanor almost as wiry as his fur, the anxiety on his face is plain. Wearing decent attire but stutters and has eyes that distrust everything."***

**Nyanko Peacekeepers**
*Rai-Neko, N/A, N/A (Peacekeeper)*
Militant enforcers of Nyanko that serve to "keep the peace", enforcing its brutal justice system. They choose non-lethal methods in order to publicly display criminals later.
***"Equipped with powerful, repurposed Startech and absolute authority, it is well-known to be a model citizen while Peacekeepers are roaming the streets."***

#### **Key Locations:**
**Drop Site**
***"Despite their overbearing presence, the Peacekeepers cannot patrol every winding, tiny alleyway in Nyanko. This is one of them."***
The drop site is a cramped and shaded alleyway, comprised of only 2 Battlefield Areas - one where the party comes in and one for X. 

**Warehouse**
***"The dusty remnants of a well-used, now-abandoned Startech warehouse hides the activities of the Clan here - manufacturing replicas with Puretech."***
One base of operations where the Clan manufactures replica items. It is located in an older, abandoned part of Nyanko, ruined by an explosive mistake many years ago

**Nyanko Sewers**
***"Surprisingly, these sewers are mostly rather clean despite being a veritable labyrinth. That said, it is not without its roaming deranged Drone or two."***
See the Adventure Site page for information on navigating the sewers. Depending on the difficulty desired, consider adding Bonuses or Penalties to Stealth Checks based on how echo-y the tunnels are.

#### Secrets and Clues
1. Some Mundymutt Ruff Riders have taken to doing underhanded deals with the Seeing Eyes Clan under the loosely shared goal of "undermining Nyanko rule". Their relationship is a strained one.
2. Runt was informed that a direct Clan representative would be meeting X for the trade-off.
3. Runt suspected a breakdown of relations between the Clans and believes that by tipping off the Peacekeepers, he can save his own skin.
4. A tracking device planted onto the Salvage itself was what let the Peacekeepers know where the hand-off was occurring.
5. The sushi house is a front but also a legitimate restaurant that has ties to other locations in the Galvanus Archipelago, which supplies much of its fish.
6. The Nyanko government keeps a tight grip on the supply of Startech throughout the population, seeing it as a means to control.
7. The Seeing Eyes Clan seeks to undermine the government by distributing cheap Startech replications made with Puretech instead.

#### Quest Resolution
**Rewards:** The party will receive Hearty Meal and Excellent Service [Hearty Meal + Excellent Service. Source pg. 201] amenities for free as long as they stay in Nyanko at the sushi house. Anubis gives the party the agreed upon 200C plus an additional 100C for the troubles.

If a member particularly impresses Anubis, he will consider offering the application of [Clan Tattoos], a symbol of Clan acceptance.

**Clan Tattoos**
*Tattoos with ink rumored to derive from a Deva itself, they are said to provide the Clan's protection and authority no matter where one is.*
When applied, they function as a set of Magnificent Light Armor [Source, pg. 166] that cannot suffer Armor Crash Injuries.
