Wedding Crashers:
- Shadow Sea Pirates
- Night Haven wedding 

The Door Dasher:
- The Door Dasher has finally been spotted in a location where it *might* be possible to trap it long enough to open the door.
- Last component for a thesis by a graduate researcher
- Idea around it is to have the party be creative in tackling the Door Dasher problem, however...
- ...rival group (Magia University?) caught wind of a similar idea and thus it will be a game of rivals to who can open the door first.
- Needs to be a particularly interesting location where there is a chase sequence 
	- Taaga jungle going through the jungle over a river waterfall into some ruins alluding to the door's origins?
	- Machine Labyrinth, getting lost in that hell - dodging rampaging machines, dodging an active engagement between Old Iron x New ore?

Foes in the Foliage:
- Murk
- Local herbalist has asked the party to protect
- Minions of the Unshaped attempt to sabotage the tree transformation as it undermines their influence in the Outer World

Crossed Bones:
- Shadowed Lands
- Day of Rekindled Lights - day to remember all the Knights of the Lanterns who have fallen protecting the roads and people of the Wistful Dark. Any recovered fallen lanterns are placed into a local remembrance site and are re-lit as people send sky lanterns out over the tundra.
- Set in the village of Grimund (Grim End), a tiny sun shard haven
	- Set on a devastating battlefield between Akenia and Calian
	- Left the area scorched and desolate
- Set on one of the main crossroads through the Shadowed Lands, and as such, has a high rate of Knights and recovered Lanterns passing through.
	- The entire surrounding tundra of the town by this point are ancient armaments in the ground and set lanterns.

Prickly's R&R:
- Something in the Thunda Sands to do with cactus folk/Prickly's R&R
- "Welcome to the Prickly Tavern, don't worry, the drinks are sharp but they ain't pointy!"
