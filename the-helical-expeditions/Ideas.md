Wedding Crashers:
- Shadow Sea Pirates
- Night Haven wedding 

The Door Dasher:
- The Door Dasher has finally been spotted in a location where it *might* be possible to trap it long enough to open the door.
- Last component for a thesis by a graduate researcher
- Idea around it is to have the party be creative in tackling the Door Dasher problem, however...
- ...rival group (Magia University?) caught wind of a similar idea and thus it will be a game of rivals to who can open the door first.
- Needs to be a particularly interesting location where there is a chase sequence 
	- Taaga jungle going through the jungle over a river waterfall into some ruins alluding to the door's origins?
	- Machine Labyrinth, getting lost in that hell - dodging rampaging machines, dodging an active engagement between Old Iron x New ore?

Foes in the Foliage:
- Murk
- Local herbalist has asked the party to protect
- Minions of the Unshaped attempt to sabotage the tree transformation as it undermines their influence in the Outer World

Crossed Bones:
- Shadowed Lands
- Day of Rekindled Lights - day to remember all the Knights of the Lanterns who have fallen protecting the roads and people of the Wistful Dark. Any recovered fallen lanterns are placed into a local remembrance site and are re-lit as people send sky lanterns out over the tundra.
- Set in the village of Grimund (Grim End), a tiny sun shard haven
	- Set on a devastating battlefield between Akenia and Calian
	- Left the area scorched and desolate
- Set on one of the main crossroads through the Shadowed Lands, and as such, has a high rate of Knights and recovered Lanterns passing through.
	- The entire surrounding tundra of the town by this point are ancient armaments in the ground and set lanterns.
- Their lanterns got left behind on the battlefield, covered by vine. 
	- Turn to locate the lanterns
	- Turn to undo the vines
	- Turn to pick it up
- Skelemaster of a Knight leads them to a battlefield, ghostly visage of a lamp in its hand (to indicate that perhaps)
- Skelemen have been seen walking to the remembrance cite as night and are seen as a bad omen for the ceremony.

- Rebreathers
- Sentient alien reef?

Emberclaw Brigade:
- *The Emberclaw Brigade is a nomadic tribe of fiery Salamanders that primarily live on the seas, and have built a lineage of powerful fire magicks. They've been eternally tasked by some entity - likely a whimsical Unshaped - to wage war against water itself. So, what better battlefield than the sea? While they primarily stick to the Shining Sea around Taaga (due to the prevalence of massive sea life), they on occasion make landfall most to resupply. Sometimes, however, they land to celebrate the heroic slaying of a notable sea monster. This is one such occasion, and you find yourself swept up in spirit as a boatload of Emberclaws march into the beachside bar you are relaxing in.*
