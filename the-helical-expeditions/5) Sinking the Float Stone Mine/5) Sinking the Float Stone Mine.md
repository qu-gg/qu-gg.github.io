#### **Adventure Description:** 
Two witnesses in a floating island mining malpractice whistleblowing scheme have been placed into the party’s care. Their testimonies about their employer are damning, and could ruin the mining corporation. Can the party escort the whistleblowers to court before someone tries to silence the truth?

#### **Starting the Adventure:** 
*“Malpractice in Go Isle's Float Stone Mine led to the collapse of one of its sites...into the Shining Sea below...and the injury of its employees. Members of the Shinobi Rebellion have discreetly asked for your help with escorting two whistleblowers to a Shogun Court hearing taking place on a neighboring island. The pair have been under the Rebellion's care until now, as their accounts could ruin the mining company and its investors. However, open support of the Rebellion would tarnish the whistleblowers' credibility, so the task is up to a third-party: you.”*

Begin the story after the party have already met and agreed to the task with the Shinobi Rebellion, by means of a shadowy representative named Lithe. In a flashback, they mentioned diversion skyships will be flying in the area to confuse trackers, so it should be a straightforward, simple ride. The party is headed to the neighboring floating island of Rotso not but a day's travel dawnward. There, a court review on the mining operations is occurring tomorrow and will be the perfect situation to blow open the whistleblowers' report. Unknownst to the party, however, the local lord has caught wind of these plans and will do anything to prevent this - even as far as parlaying with the dreaded assassin Hiratagaan. 

#### **Suggested Story:**
1. Set the scene, have the party depart from Go Isle's skyport with Garret and Isaiah, then continue:
2. **Set Up and Set Off:**
	1. The witnesses are scared, but brave enough to continue on the skyship. They are Basic Folk however, since named, roll on the Injury Table when dropped to 0 Hearts.
3. **On the Journey:**
	1. If the party look for anyone following them, they will only see a few circling Skyrays. Eventually the party must rest.
	2. At night, Ayakashi sneaks into Isaiah’s tent using its Phantom Abomination Ability and tries to kill him. If discovered, Ayakashi will attack the party briefly, then flee. This is a chance for them to learn about the Ability, and how to counter-act it.
	3. The following day, the group sees a stranded skyship in the air - sails cut and the alone pilot asking for help. The pilot is actually Hiratagaan in illusion; he will attack a witness before fleeing again. 
		1. On the stranded ship is one surviving crew member, Captain Delain, who has information on the lord's investments in the mining company and potentially other clues.
4. **Fight the Good Fight:**
	1. Before the party reach Rosto, Hiratagaan descends once more, ambushing with his *Wrath of the Dragon* Ability to set the Skyship on fire. This causes Areas to become Harmful and the ship to plummet in 3 Turns if not dealt with. This time, he will fight to "death".
	2. With Hiratagaan defeated, the surviving witnesses can be delivered to court and give their report. Lord X and CEO Wiles Go are present. The party may deliver their own report, if they so choose.

#### **Important Characters:**
**Rahm Nobell**
*Tenebrate, Male, 45 (Basic Folk)*
Mine site administrator who saw the directors sign off on risky construction and digging methods, which was a cause in the chains snapping and the mine site falling.
***"Fidgety and wide-eyed, this spectacled tenebrate has been on a streak of paranoia which, after having literally fallen from the sky, is a little understandable."***

**Kssek**
*Promethean, Male, 32 (Basic Folk)*
A relatively new miner who was ordered to reinforce some connective chains using an illegal, but much cheaper, building technique.
***"It is clear to see what happened to Kssek as half of his face alongside his left arm and leg are now that of a stark white reptile. Despite this, he carries an upbeat attitude."***

**Captain Delain**
*Tenebrate, Female, 37 (Guide)*
A very experienced pilot-for-hire around the Rotso region, Captain Delain has taken many delivery jobs for the Go Mining Corporation.
***"A sharp skillset and even sharper attire, Captain Delain is a well-known independent captain within the region. Before she was found on-board, she has already tended to her, seemingly serious, wounds."***

#### **Key Locations:**
**Go Isle's Float Stone Mine**
***"Called Go Isle, the mine is actually a series of connected floating islands by way of many now rusting chains, built presumably by Gley. Ancient architecture rebuilt betrays their natural beauty."***
Rediscovered as a prominent Float Stone source by Wiles Go in the 4th Aeon, Wiles has since aggressively built up the Go Mining Corporation which supplies most of Outer World's supply. 

Folks employed here stay on the islands for multiple month stints before taking leave back to the surface, wherever they're from. As such, information coming out of the island is well-controlled by management.

**Cloud Breaker**
***"Soaring over the Shining Sea in a Cloud Breaker is a gorgeous visual. To the one side, the dark blanket of the Wistful Dark; the other the purple and pink hues of a far distant Blazing Garden. Below? A long, long drop into glistening waters."***
One of the many Portian skyships seen throughout the Twilight Meridian, this one is a bit larger of a vessel meant for material transportation. It has accommodations of two rooms with bunks, albeit not luxurious ones. As part of the disguise, this skyship is arrived to be loaded up with an actual shipment of Float Stone destined to Rotso.

**Rotso**
***"An industrial floating city, Rotso is the center of float stone refinement and skyship construction. Given Float Stone...floats, it was found easier to work with directly in the sky. High stone walkways form thruwys throughout the city."***
Rotso has one of the highest skyship densities in the world given its many manufacturers. As such, it is a prime location for the party to purchase one at-cost. The court is primarily a civil court handling business logistics and is conveniently within the sky port center but has the full jurisdiction of the Shogun Banner.

#### Secrets and Clues
1. Hiratagaan has been given many names by his victims over the years, such as the "Phantom Terror", but is known as the best assassin for hire.
2. Hiratagaan has an otherworldly weakness to the sound of musical instruments, seemingly forcing him to the material world.
3. Hiratagaan doesn't use all of his skills in the first fights with the party, in an attempt to gauge their power. 
4. Without the testimonies of either whistleblower, the Go Mining Corporation CEO Wiles Go will be able to cover up the incidents during the court review.
5. The local Lord X is a stark supporter of the Shogun within the Seven Holy Isles, having been gifted this fiefdom of floating isles after betraying his former mentor.
6. The court, like many throughout the Dynasty, belongs to the Shogun and will be a fair judge in this hearing. 
7. Damage to the mining company is a huge blow to Lord X, who is heavily invested in them for resources.
8. The next-in-line to the Go Mining Corporation secretly supports the Shinobi Rebellion and has agreed to supply them much-needed Float Stone at good rates.
9. The ritual to parlay with Hiratagaan leaves a permanent mark on the summoner, which is the reason Lord X is wearing a ridiculously high turtleneck to the court.

#### Quest Resolution
**Rewards:** If successful, Lithe will have delivered the party 4 Units of Float Stone [Source, pg. 289] to their inn the following day, alongside a cryptic invite to speak should they seek more work. The whistleblowers profusely thank the party for the protection.

If the party can connect and expose the local lord as having parleyed with this infamous demon, then the Shogun courts will have no option but to depose of him. The courts will then gift the party 400C and 2 Units of [Dusk Amber](https://breakrpg.blogspot.com/2025/11/twilight-meridian-items-freebie-gear.html) in the shape of the Shoguns Banner for exposing treason.

It would be bad for the party if their connection to the Rebellion comes to light in the court.
