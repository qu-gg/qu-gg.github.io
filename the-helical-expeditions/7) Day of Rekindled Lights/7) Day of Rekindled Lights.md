#### **Adventure Description:** 
On the night before a remembrance ceremony for the Knights of the Lantern, the party find that one fallen Knight is no longer resting in peace. They must work with a local priest to help the Knight's soul find rest before the ceremony, but not is all as holy as it seems for the clergy in town.

#### **Starting the Adventure:** 
*In the chilly and haunted tundra of the Shadowed Lands, you finally arrive at Grim Crossing. It is a desperate little Sun Shard haven built on the region's main fork and acts as the main quarters of the Knights of the Lantern, a chivalric order that protects the roads. On the morrow, you plan to attend the Day of Rekindled Lights, a remembrance ceremony for fallen Knights. But for now, the bitter winds whip loudly at your cloaks as you attempt to locate an inn amongst a handful of bleak buildings.*

The lantern graveyard the party are due to visit is being haunted by the skeletal remains of Sir Gerard Laughs-a-Lot, alongside the echoes of other fallen soldiers. Note that while Sir Gerard has the stats of a Skele-Master, he cannot speak like others can (for purposes of buffing his stats easily while keeping the story working). Though they disagree on principles of belief, the Knights have a good relationship with the Priest and trust her advice on certain matters. As such, the potential reveal that she's the cause of the restless dead will be hard-hitting for the Knights.

#### **Suggested Story:**
1. Set the scene, describe Grim Crossing and its inn, then continue:
2. **Undead Visitor:**
	1. A local Knight staggers into the inn, shakily reporting that the undead have returned, cursing about the "lost lanterns causing this". He looks at the party, asking for help and to seek out the local priest who has been helping with the situation while he continues looking.
	2. The desolate-looking church is pointed out and the party meet Priest Lieza. She explains her efforts so far, and gives them a method against the undead, the use of Bright Water. She has applied it twice so far but was wounded from it last time so she cannot go herself.
3. **The Spicy Dead:**
	1. At the lantern site, the party see the undead Knight riding a Rokko-Do Skeleton. The rider is Sir Gerard Laughs-a-Lot, who attempts to lead the party to the traditional lantern storage site. If attacked, he will not strike back.
	2. At the storage site, the party are attacked by 2 Ghost Peppers. They are immune to Mundane Damage unless Bright Water is applied to them. Nearby, the party find clues linking the stolen lanterns back to Lieza.
4. **Clergy's Shadows**
	1. When confronted, Lieza will confess to having buried the lanterns but try and deflect guilt as much as possible. She gives the bury location but begs the party not to tell the townsfolk about it
	2. At the hiding spot, the party must dig a hole, break through roots, and pick up the lanterns. As the party starts to dig, Malignant Echoes of the lanterns' owners rise and attack. Each step takes an Action and Turn to complete.
	3. With the lanterns retrieved, the disturbances cease. Sir Gerard blesses the party with his sword before striding off, and the Knights profusely thank the party. The ceremony goes ahead as planned, and Lieza's fate is left up to the party.

#### **Important Characters:**
**Dame Mico**
Human, Female, 25 (Custrel)
A younger Knight of the Lantern, Dame Mico is also the current caretaker of retrieved lanterns for the remembrance day within Grim Crossing.
***"Donning the standard attire of a Lantern Knight - silvery metals housing yellow cloth - Dame Mico whips around in a panic looking for any aid."***

**Priest Lieza**
*Human, Female, 46 (Basic Folk)*
Priest of the Church of the Sacred Chain, she has come to Grim Crossing in an attempt to convert the populace, and has gotten desperate as attempts fail.
***"She wraps her flowing vestments around her like a cloak, her shiver seeming to come from more than the mere cold."***

**Sir Gerard Laughs-a-Lot**
*Undead, Male, 165 (Skelemaster)*
A fallen Knight of the Lantern, who used to guide the way for those in need. His lantern was lost long ago, and now in undeath, he tries to aid the lost. 
**"Demonic scratches riddle the rider's back, making his cause of death clear. He and his Rokko-Do wear frost-covered, metal Armor of the Lantern."**

#### **Key Locations:**
**Grim Crossing**
***"Hope is a hard thing to muster in the Shadowed Lands but it seems to have clustered here in the faces of these hardy folk."***
A small Shard haven set on an ancient battleground of experimental weapons, Grim Crossing sits on the main fork in the Shadowed Lands. Given its location and traffic, it has become the main quarters for the Knights of the Lantern.

**Church of the Sacred Chain**
***"Even amongst the bleak houses of Grim Crossing, somehow this desolate church sticks out as particularly depressed."***
Not having been given much funding from the larger organization in Shard, Lieza has had to "make do" in setting up her place of worship. Some hand-me-down iconography and texts are all that is to be found here.

**The Lantern Fields**
***"Despite the intent, the ambiance of dozens of rusty lantern weapons planted among a frosted war-torn field is disconcerting."***
The Day of Rekindled Lights has been a long-standing tradition, and over the Aeon has, unfortunately, accumulated many, many lanterns. In the center, Sir Gerard waits impassively upon his steed.

#### Secrets and Clues
1. The battlefield upon which Grim Crossing sits was the site of a wicked confrontation between Akenia and Calian, where each used experimental weapons in a show of force, irreparably scarring the land.
2. Priest Lieza has been trying to convert folks here to the Church of the Sacred Chain, though has had a hard time as people look to the Knights of the Lantern for realizable hope instead.
3. She buried the lantern in a desperate attempt to ruin the ceremony and discourage people, showing the Knights of the Lanterns failing. She hoped it would "encourage" people to accept the Knights of the Sacred Chain as their protectors instead. 
4. She didn't know that burying the lanterns would cause the undead to appear, but plans to leverage solving it as a means to convince people of her faith.
5. The method she employs to tackle this undead is destructive, severing its connection to the Outer World, rather than putting the soul at rest.
6. Priest Lieza's wound, if investigated, doesn't seem to align with her story - it isn't a slashing wound but rather looks burned.
7. The clues linking the stolen weapons back to Lieza: ripped cloth fabric matches Sacred Chain colors,  the knight's sword is clean, and there are some lingering Bright Water effects.
8. The Day of Rekindled Lights serves another purpose besides remembrance. The "light" left in a fallen Knight's memory is a tangible thing, and is used to reinforce wards on the roads.

#### Quest Resolution
**Rewards:** Upon retrieving the lanterns and defeating the Malignant Echoes, Sir X will appear, dismount, and offer his Lantern Sword on one knee. Upon returning the lanterns to the town, the Knights of the Lantern will gift the party 100C and a Unit of Sun Gold they haven't been able to put to use.

**Gerard's Lantern Sword** [Master Weapon + Utility] 
*Gerard's blade was known throughout the Shadowed Lands as a beacon any could follow and feel not only safe, but hope.* 
Made of Sun Gold and deals Bright Damage. 
As an Action, the sword can light up as if using the Sage's Magelight Ability [Source, pg. 59].
2 Slot. 75C.
