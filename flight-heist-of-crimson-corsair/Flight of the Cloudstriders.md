You can find more of their work here (https://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?author=Marco%20Michelutto). I recommend supporting the original module if you enjoyed this one, as this one wouldn't have been possible otherwise!

Artworks are drawn from various sources and artists, with appropriate credit links underneath each one. None of the artwork (to my knowledge) is AI-generated in this module. As well, I am not making any profit off of this work and sharing it freely for the BREAK!! community.

Feel free to stop by the official BREAK!! Discord and leave any comments or a review if you played through this adventure. I'd love to hear your experience.

#### Introduction
This story starts with the [[Duke of Red Roses]] transporting a mysterious person to their primary enclave of Night Haven while first making a stop to the floating island of Oki Island. According to trustworthy sources, this person was found inside the ruins of a Gleysian mana refinery and has information on how to access a particularly interesting reliquary called the Hall of Truths in the Shining Sea.

The [[Duke of Red Roses]] is interested in leveraging whatever relics are in here to finally seize full control of the Shining Sea, becoming *the* leader of the seas and skies over the Meridian. Of course, Professor QU-66 of the [[Helical Research Archive]] cannot let them have this information...not because of any moral duty or "keeping the seas free" but because the Hall of Truths may reveal how bio-mechanoids might finally *finally* enjoy drinks from Kinoko Café. As such, QU-66 has employed [[The Cloudstriders]] to have this person extracted and delivered.

Which organization will control this important source of information at the end of this adventure? Will the party finish the contract for [[The Cloudstriders]], or be tempted by the [[Duke of Red Roses]]? This module will create the opportunity for your players to side with either.

###### Homebrew Background:
While working on some of the faction adaptations for the module, a lot of pieces clicked into place for the Cloudstriders and how they could be a background itself for Players. Included here is a homebrewed background. If one of the players wants to choose this background themself for the module, I'd say let them!  You'd likely want to take some angle that they just fell in with this specific skyship crew (e.g. transferred over from another mission, just graduated, etc.) in order to keep the 'we need fresh faces' idea later to work. Perhaps its a way for them to gain trust quickly with the crew!

**Holy Isle Cloudstrider (Homeland: Twilight Meridian)** 
You were a cloudstrider of the Shinobi Rebellion.  
Your goal? Take down the skyships of the Shogun atop your other half - your skyray. 
Unfortunately, you were the ones taken down. 

**Purviews:** 
- Death-defying balance. 
- Arriving without notice. 
- Knowing how to take things down. 

**Starting Gear (Pick 2):** 
- Rebreather, _oxygen mask_ 
- Light Armor, _cloud suit_ 
- Arc Weapon, _sky spear_ 
- Pet: Skree, _baby skyray

#### Words of Advice
This adventure starts *in media res*. The party, and they may or may not be a party already, has already accepted a job with the Cloudstriders.

Because you are taking away some of their agency, it’s important to give some back to them right away.

Ask each player, *at the beginning of the session*:
> So your character decided to accept this mission with an infamous band of sky mercenaries… why?   Was it for money? <br> A thirst for adventure? <br> Or are they maybe running away from something?”

Remember to say **YES** to your players when they come up with this bit of backstory. Let them contribute to this story you are creating together.

If you are running this adventure as the start of a campaign, you may need to think of what kind of recompense you want the Cloudstriders to have offered the party. Remember that the recompense will be increased at the beginning of Chapter 2. I will leave this part up to you, as this is something that will likely affect your campaign and it has to work for your group.

If you run this as a one-shot, you can simply tell the party they are offered “an appropriate amount of money and free airfare” (or go wild, say 1000 coins!).

If you have time, and especially if you are thinking about running this adventure as the start of a campaign, consider running a one-on-one improv session with each of the players. In these sessions you can have Cormack show up out of the blue and offer them a job, and play out how they accept it. It could be a nice way for the player to develop their backstory and to show how the Cloudstriders have a wide reach, and can turn up pretty much anywhere in the Shining Sea.

#### Chapter 1 - The Nightjar
>  *Stormy skies are all around you as you stand on the deck of the Nightjar, a sleek airship shaped like a bird of prey. The ride has been comfortable despite the strong winds, and the deck barely sways under your feet as you pierce through the dark clouds.* 
>  *Suddenly, the ship exits the clouds and enters an area of impossibly twilight blue skies over the shimmering sea, with the half-orb floating island ahead that seems to abide by its own rules when it comes to the weather.* 
>  *Around you on the deck of the ship many of the crew members start preparations for landing as the Nightjar lowers slowly towards the island. Three Chibs, tiny doll-like folk who are covered head-to-toe in armored skin-tight apparel with these small hovering manta-ray-like creatures by them, are chatting merrily at one end of the ship. [[Cormack]], the human that hired you all, is leaning on the railings on the other side, looking into the distance.* 
>  *As you fly towards what you can now see is a large and colorful city with a brilliant deep blue stone that holds it aloft. Still seeing the storm clouds that you just came from behind you, ahead lies a zone of impossibly good weather surrounding the island as various light beams shine into the sky above it and gorgeous waterfalls cascade off the sides down blow. Only now you remember suddenly that you don’t know exactly what you’re supposed to do Oki Island...*

**What is the goal of this section?**
This short part of the adventure serves to stretch the group’s roleplaying muscles and to explain the goal of the adventure. If the party does not immediately go to Cormack, he will approach them, but let the players interact with each other or members of the crew first if they want.

###### **In short: 
What is the party told?**
The Cloudstriders have been hired to extract a person of interest from one of the Duke's airships. They need fresh faces to find out what ship this person will be in, and that’s why the party was hired. 

The lead the party can work with is that Mamba and Grum, two guards that will be on that airship, are in town for the night.

**What can the party find out?**
If the party ask other crew members and are very convincing, they may find out that the Cloudstriders’ plan is to send the three chibs to board the ship and extract the target. 

They could also find out that the [[Helical Research Archive]] hired the Cloudstriders, and that this person may be the key to accessing the Hall of Truths under the Shining Sea, housing *what knows what*?

**Other stuff the party may want to know**
Oki Island is part of the Galvanus Trade Guilds but is controlled directly by Portia themselves. They use powerful and old Akenian magics to change the weather in the area so that it is always pleasant, as this island serves both as a hub for their airships and a resort for wealthy people from all over the Outer World. 

The party can expect to find all sorts of establishments on the island, including bars and casinos. Some crew members will be excited at the prospect of doing some gambling, some will warn the party that the place is overly tacky and a bit of a tourist trap.

###### **Scene:**
[[Cormack]] will approach the party and explain the mission in more details. He is a human in his forties. Tall and lean, he usually wears an aviator jacket that stops at the elbow on his left arm where his prosthetic forearm is revealed. Despite his grouchy face and monotonous low voice, he is usually in a fairly pleasant mood...after his vitality fizz pop for the day.

The party already met Cormack when he recruited them, and he is the only familiar face on this ship.
![[Cormack.jpg|200]]
> *Image of Cormack, happily enjoying a fresh cup*
> Art: https://www.pinterest.co.kr/pin/35606653298035472/

Here's an example of what Cormack may say:
> *"You folks have a vital part in this job. You see, we often* *recover artifacts and objects of value for our customers,* *but this time we were asked to recover a person. All we* *know is that they will be on an airship tomorrow morning,* *but not which one."*
> *"We are not quite sure where this person is being sent next* *and that’s your job to find out, so that our infiltrators can* *do their part (gestures towards the chibs). We don’t* *want to put on names on high alert with Night Haven in this sector just yet, so we need fresh faces like you to snoop* *around and find out what we need."*

If asked about the Cloudstriders, he might say:
> *"Asking about us, eh? Well, depending on who you ask, you may've heard a few different stories - either crazy anarchists trying to take down the ol' Duke or the crazy sky pirates leading a rebellion over the Holy Isles. Either way, crazy but, hey, least we're free up here."*

Cormack also gives the party a small metal disk that when activated produces a minor illusion a few inches tall. This illusion shows two men dressed in the uniforms of the Duke's guards: their names are Grum (a dwarf) and Mamba (a promethean). 

The Cloudstriders know from a reliable source that those two will be assigned to the same airship where the target will be. Learning either the name of the airship or where they are headed will be enough information for the Cloudstrider to know which one they need to hit. Feel free to describe Grum’s and Mamba’s appearances as you please.

###### Other NPCs on Board:
**Alewyn**: A young lavender-hued tenebrate and the pilot of the Nightjar, Sidney is stubborn and strong-willed. She talks straight and has a short temper, but is also frank and honest. Most notably, she sports a crimson-hued shadow mark on her neck - PCs from the Wistful Dark Shard cities may recognize it as a noble symbol of House Syranus. Despite the heritage, Sidney refused to continue in their line and instead exiled herself to join the Cloudstriders after witnessing their deeds in a Shard skyport. How? Why, by stowing away on their ship, of course.

If asked about the Cloudstriders, Sydney will say this is the best job she ever had, because she gets to fly the best ship she’s ever seen and be with the best crew.

Her dream is to one day break through the Heaven's Seal and explore whatever's past it. She is sure she can build the right ship for the job...somehow...if she could just convince the Helical Research Archive to fund her work. If any member of the group is a Rai-Neko, she may excitedly ask if they've ever been past the Seal or have older relatives that remember any stories.

**Furling**: a small and young goblin who talks very little, if at all, and avoids eye contact. He dreams of becoming a pilot.

**Pip, Bip, Tip**: Three brash and arrogant chibs. Party hard college kids who are on their semester break currently. They are not meant to talk about the mission, but will easily be convinced to talk if they can brag about how daring they are.  The Cloudstriders are planning to drop them on the airship transporting the target from above, so that they can sneak in and extract them. They haven't been operating much in this area yet due to the distance from Stahlfeld and Night Haven so the Duke is unlikely to expect it here of all places.

The three are likely to go on-and-on about how smart they are because they could start cloud-surfing super young even when the skyrays were babies. You could use it to mention some of the Cloudstrider lore here and culture of skyray-bonding. They might also slip up that the reason they signed up was to get onto Oki Island and party (see Chapter 3). 

###### Finalizing:
After the party has had the goal of the adventure explained, and the players had some fun roleplaying, progress to the next chapter.

#### Chapter 2 - Oki Island
> *The Nightjar finally docks at a small tower at the edge of Oki Island on the duskward-side. You can see the city sprawling in front of you: the old port where you are now, and the newer and bigger one on the other side of town, the entertainment district between with its many lights and a few large casinos, the many resorts and villas on the hills just above where a quiet-looking park hosts a splendid temple.*
> *Dominating everything else looms a large building shaped like a copper and steel tree with many branches. It is the biggest airship docking station in the Shining Sea, affectionately called The Pole by the citizens of Oki Island. Buzzing around it you see airships coming and leaving, and smaller flying gondolas containing Portian workers controlling the traffic in and out with glowing wands of different colors. The Portian Confederacy controls this city, Cormack reminds you.*
> *“So try not to be too conspicuous once you are in town. Even if it's not Duke-controlled, I can only assume they'll have a personal security presence given the cargo. Grum and Mamba will probably be somewhere easy to find, like a casino or one of the bars, but remember you only have a few hours to find them.” 
> You descend to the old town, and ready yourself to enter the city proper. In front of you a few choices: will you visit the beachfront? The entertainment district with its casinos? Or maybe the temple you could see from above?

###### In Short:
**Description:** Think of a small Las Vegas on the beach. Tacky, fun, relaxed.
**Inhabitants**: 14,200 of all species.
**Who is in charge**: Portian Confederacy, *the* trading guild of Galvanus.

**What is the goal of this section?**
Wherever the party decides to explore, let them have some fun with the environment at first. Grum and Mamba will then show up, and I will provide some examples of interactions the party may have with them at each location. 

The key thing to keep in mind here is that the party **will** get this information, how is a matter of what they find fun and interesting. 

Simply present a situation and go with whatever harebrained scheme your players decide to try. Keep the checks easy through Bonuses/Purviews (no matter how much of a stretch the Purviews may be), and allow them to fail forward in fun ways if they don't make them at all. Things will get much more structured in Chapter 3. 

The correct airship is the **Crimson Corsair** and the destination is **The City of Paths**. The city proper has plenty of establishments of all sorts and they all welcome travelers. For the purpose of this adventure, I will list some areas and some examples of establishments that can be found there, but feel free to improvise and create locations on the fly to suit your group’s wishes. This part of the adventure can be very freeform, if that is what the group wants.

The party can now go wherever they please within Oki Island, with the exception of the private residences, of course. Security is overall very loose, as this is a place where rich people come to unwind and gamble. If the party decides to break into private residences, you have the option of using the **Killservant** statblock (pg. 388) against them.

The residents are also enjoying their freedom from many of the laws and regulations of other cities in the continent. The party is allowed to bring weapons with them, but violence is not tolerated and there are guards patrolling the streets and trying to stop any trouble. Use the **Custrel** statblock (pg. 186) as a guide.

###### The Rainbow Promenade:
A series of stalls placed one next to the other on the beachfront and painted in many different colors. All sorts of establishments are here: bars, shops, food vendors and pretty much anything the party wants to visit. A few of the stalls host carnival games. Here’s a couple you can have the party play:

**Whack-a-Grub**:
> *A short dwarf dressed in a tacky fake ranger uniform beckons the party over to a large table with 9 holes on the top.* 
> *“Yer’ look like the kind that can fight off them nasty grubs!” he says, handing over a wooden mallet painted to look like a warhammer. “They be coming out of the frikkin’ floor! Only one silver piece to try your skills!”. Tip: try to make the accent sound as fake as possible, as it is in fact an act this dwarf is putting on.* 
> *Once someone pays the silver piece and takes the mallet, the game starts as the dwarf activates a magic switch and the table starts glowing faintly blue. Each turn a wooden statuette depicting a pudge grub will come out of one of the holes, and the player has to try and hit it.*

Rules:
- The game lasts 5 rounds
- For each round, whoever is playing has to pass a Deftness Check as one grub comes out of one of the holes. On a success, they hit the grub.

Prizes:
- 1-2 successes: a small flower pot (worth 1 Stone)
- 3-4 successes: a stuffed snarl (worth 5 Stones)
- 5 successes: a large medal, plated with gold (worth 1 Coin). Inscribed on it are the words: *“I hit a lot of rats with a hammer and all I got was this lousy medal”*.

If the party wins the medal, they can decide to get the stuffed snarl instead.

Deva Boranel and the Stuffed Snarl:
- Stuffed snarls are very popular across the Galvanus Archipelago and can often be won as prizes for carnival games. The tradition was inspired by a Snarl-shaped Deva named Boranel, who famously interceded to protect some of the peaceful floating islands during The Sundering. Kids love to play with these stuffed snarls all over the archipelago, so much so that they have a common nickname: Borries.

**Hit the Cans**:
> *A tall and flamboyant woman sporting a fake handlebar moustache invites you over to try your skill. Behind her and the counter, a pyramid of 15 cans is stacked on top of a colorful table. A player can have a go for one stone and try to knock them over.* 
> *Optional challenge: a small golden ring hangs next to the pyramid. If asked, the carnie explains that it is an expert challenge, for the skilled players only! Sending one ball through the golden ring wins the player a pair of Spring Heel Boots. In the great tradition of carnival games though, this challenge is near impossible: players roll at a Snag and have to roll below a 2.*

Spring Heel Boots:
- Made of magical feathers which grants Supernatural Leaping
- Supernatural Leaping: 
	- You are able to clear great distances in a single bound. 
	- During a Fight, you can leap up to 2 Battlefield Areas away and still take your Action. 
	- Leaping allows you to reach elevated locations beyond normal reach. For example, jumping up to strike an airborne foe or to gain access to a distant ledge. Your GM will decide what’s possible. 
	- If you can control your descent, you avoid Falling Injury when landing from great heights.

Rules:
- The player tries three Attacks as they are handed three wooden balls. 
- Instead of an AC for the pyramid, the player knocks over one can for each point over 10 they roll. 
	- For example, on a roll of 12 total two cans are knocked over. 
	- On a roll of 20, all cans are knocked over.

Prizes:
- 5-10 cans: a small flower pot (worth 1 Stone)
- 11-14 cans: a large stuffed snarl (worth 5 Stones)
- 15 cans: a charm on a string that causes an illusory butterfly to fly around the wearer. This comes in varying colors: roll 1d6 to see what color the winner gets (1-red, 2-green, 3-blue, 4-purple, 5-orange, 6-white).

If the party wins the charm, they can decide to get the stuffed snarl instead.

Meeting Grum and Mamba at the promenade:
- If the party decides to stop at the promenade, allow for one scene to play out and then have Grum and Mamba arrive at one of the carnival games. It could be the one the party is playing, or if they decided to stop at another establishment it would be the stall right next to it. 
- Grum will try to win a stuffed plushie with no luck. He will loudly complain about his bad luck and tell Mamba that they can’t leave until he wins, as he promised his son a stuffed snarl from the games. He will fly home on his next assignment the day after. (hint: learning where he is from will then be one way to learn which airship the Cloudstriders have to hit!)
- **Note:** The party could now try to win a stuffed snarl for Grum and befriend him, pickpocket him and find a clue that his hometown is The City of Paths, or anything that your players think will work. They will come up with some crazy ideas. The key is to let the party play them out with some added rolls for suspense.

###### Funland:
Between the beachfront and the nice villas and resorts on the hills stands the entertainment district of Oki Island. Plenty of restaurants, clubs and arcades are available. Low-level magic has been made abundantly available, especially in a city like this one, so make use of *minor illusion* and other such spells to create a vibrant, colorful district where signs are illuminated in many colors. The people on the streets wear magical fabrics like Twilight Silk and Pilose Bumpo Fleece, clothes imbued with arcane properties so that patterns and colors shift and change.

The three most prominent buildings in the area are three giant casinos, each with a different theme from around the Outer World. (Optional) There is a chance that the party may stumble upon any one of Pip, Bip, or Tip in the casinos, seemingly partying pretty hard.

**Arena of Spirits** is a desert-themed bar where patrons can watch or participate in friendly duels and competitions that are reminiscent of the Arena challenges from the Sol Alliance. 
- Special evenings are themed as "Champions' Nights", where customers can dress up and "battle" in staged, safe skirmishes using foam weapons. 
- They offer a "Monster Meal Challenge" where guests try and finish a massive, beast-sized platter of food in under an hour to win a night of free drinks.

**The Steel Maze Casino** is a casino that literally changes it layout nightly, inspired by the shifting architecture of the Buried Kingdom's Machine Labyrinth. 
- Patrons are given maps when they enter, which are only somewhat helpful, and must use it in order to track down games to play and servers for drinks. 
- The Bio-mechanoid servers seem much happier at work than any of the organic species who are dressed in bulky Drone costumes.
- The special drink here is the "Static Shock Shot", a neon blue shot infused with flecks of Lightning Gems to give a mild tingle.

**The Trickster's Taproom** is a Murk-inspired fey forest casino - full of mischievous décor, illusions, and optical tricks. 
- Slot machines in here are carved from faux trees and the ceiling is painted like a dark forest canopy. 
- Servers dress offer playful pranks with orders, like the "Ever-Filling Bread Basket" that never empties...as a poor waiter sits hidden under the table replenishing it through a trap door.
- The signature drink is the 'Fey Fizz', a stupidly sweet cocktail known for changing flavors and colors as you drink it. Every drink comes with a side of edible, themed fungi.

Rules:
- Anyone at the table who may want to have a few rounds of any card game you may find in a casino can now take use this opportunity. 
- Alternatively, they can try their luck at the slot machines, with the following rules: 1 Coin to play, roll 3d10 with the following winning combinations: 10 Stone on any roll with 2 equal dies, 1000 Stone (10 Coins) on any roll with 3 equal die, 100000 Stones (10 Gems) on 7-7-7.
- **Important**: Gambling is not a safe place for everyone, so make sure that everyone is comfortable with it. If in doubt, do not give a vulnerable player the opportunity to gamble.

Meeting Grum and Mamba in Funland:
- Mamba is an avid gambler, so the party may find him at a card table or at the slot machines losing a substantial amount of money, while Grum tries to convince him to leave. Some fun alternatives might be that they bump into them in The Steel Maze, frustratedly lost just like the party.
- **Note:** The party may entice him to bet or gamble on something, information for money, or maybe they can get him drunk enough to talk. As before, any other plan the party comes up may work.

###### The Garden of Peace:
![[GardenOfPeace.png]]
> *Garden of Peace, a walkway to the temple*
> Art: https://konradwerks.tumblr.com/image/142800826387

Located in the middle of the villas and resorts on the hills, a short distance from the city, this garden is an oasis of peace and quiet. A powerful imbuement is placed over the Garden in the form of a Silencing effect, blocking all sounds from the noisy city below but allowing for sounds to be heard within.

Access to the garden is free, though two literal **War Drones** (pg. 378) at the entrance will warn the party that this is meant to be a quiet place and disturbance will not be tolerated. The party will be approached and potentially kicked out if they go overboard. The garden is very neatly curated, and the party can see a few gardeners manually removing single leaves of grass with their hands. At the center of it there is a small lake with a bridge going over its narrowest point, and a temple with a ceiling made of glass of many colors, shining a rainbow light inside.

The temple is dedicated to the Twilight Manifest, a loose belief system whose core virtues are of moderation and balance (funnily enough, considering...). It is put as a step away from all the ruckus down below, primarily for the people that live and work here. Many teachings of the Manifest suggest seeking balance via calm contemplation on how best to harmonize their immodest tendencies. Some will even suggest to attempt equal but opposite actions to achieve true equilibrium.

Meeting Grum and Mamba at the Temple:
- Grum is a very spiritual man, and will be found meditating inside the temple. As the party enters he is finishing a rite and will make to leave shortly thereafter. He will be happy to stop and chat with the party, especially if there is a spiritual member in the group. 
- **Note:** That player may convince Grum to tell him which airship he is boarding the day after, so that they can hope for his safe travel. As before, any other plan the party comes up may work.

###### Finishing the Mission:
Once the party acquires the information and go back to the ship, they meet Alewyn on the main deck of the Nightjar. She explains that she is the only one that did not leave to have fun in town (as she promised her girlfriend she would behave). 

She will be happy to hear the mission was successful, and tell the party they will be paid in the morning once everyone is back. The party may go back to the town to have more fun, but should eventually come back to the ship and go to sleep in their quarters, only to be woken up in the middle of the night...

**Optional - Socialization**  
Here would be a great time to leverage BREAK!!'s camp rest mechanics where players can perform the Socialization Downtime (among other things). This gives them the opportunity to interact more with any given PC or NPC on the Nightjar (besides Bip, Tip, Pip who are mysteriously missing...) and give them a mechanical boost for the next day. 

Feel free to omit this depending on the pacing of the table and player interest, but if you're using this module as an introduction to BREAK!!, this is a good opportunity to showcase this aspect of the system.

###### Alternative: what if the party wants to infiltrate the ship now?
The party may decide to infiltrate the ship on their own rather than relay the information to the Cloudstriders. If that is the case I would recommend allowing them to.

The Pole, the main airship port, is a tall tower with many branches, each serving as a docking station. By the time the party has the information of what airship to board it would be late enough in the casino's daily cycle that very few people should be in it, and security is reduced to one or two guards at the main gate. 

If the party comes up with an interesting enough plan to get inside the Pole, let them infiltrate and take an elevator up to the Crimson Corsair. The way the Crimson Corsair is docked makes it so the party can only access the small platform at the back of the hull, leading into the cargo hold, that they would be boarding at the beginning of the next chapter. 

This way you have a very similar module. Read ahead the rest of the adventure and then come back to this section or they won’t make much sense, but the changes are:
- The guard in the first room is not Grum, but someone else that the party has not encountered.
- The restaurant is not open and the deck is instead empty.
- The party can explore the rest of the ship and gain access, above deck, to the sleeping quarters: Rufo is in his room, sleeping, and the keycharm level 2 can be found on his bedstand. This is a Sneak's dream!


#### Chapter 3 - Boarding the Golden Goose
> *You wake up in your cabin after only a few hours to the small goblin, Furling, jumping around and tugging on everyone’s hammock whilst signaling to go above deck. Once you get there you see the three chibs in pretty bad shape and clearly hungover, and a furious Cormack telling Bip off. The moment he sees you, though, he wears his old smile.*
> *“Looks like you guys just received a promotion! My warmest congratulations to you!” And as he says that he walks over, just as you notice that the ship is already in flight and Oki Island is only a distant speck in the night sky.*
>*As Pip, Bip, and Tip are indisposed, Cormack offers you to take on the role of infiltrators. Luckily the ship is armed with a special device. With it, the Cloudstriders can fire a magical anchor able to attach itself to the hull of another ship and create a mana zipline. Cormack reassures you that this is perfectly safe, and that he’s done it himself quite a few times.* 
>*The Nightjar can also turn invisible for short periods of time, so the party will be able to safely infiltrate the Crimson Corsair without being seen.*

Cormack provides the party with the following **equipment**:
- A **universal key** in the form of a short metal rod with some mechanical wheels on it. Cormack explains that the back entrance to the cargo area that the party is going to use is locked with a combination padlock, and this key is able to open any such lock. Unfortunately it has only one charge that cannot be recovered, so it will only be useful once.
- A **glammerbadge**, a small enameled pin in the shape of a black diamond that will make the party’s clothes and armor look as if they were wearing the Duke's Black Glove Cavalier uniforms. The disguise is not perfect, and if at any point the party behaves in a suspicious way a guard on board of the Crimson Corsair can see through it with a successful Insight Check. 
- A **small glass bead** with blue smoke swirling inside. It contains a charge of levitation activated by crushing the bead. The party gets one bead for each player, plus one extra for the person they are extracting.

**The Cloudstriders' plan:**
1) The party will zipline down to the Crimson Corsair, landing on a small platform on the lower part of the hull. From there they will open the back door with the key and enter the cargo area.
2) Making their way up the ship, they will need to avoid being discovered and reach the top level, where the prisoner is being held in a separate building on the deck.
3) Once the prisoner is freed the party is to give them the bead so that they can all escape to the skies above, where the Nightjar will collect them again 

The Crimson Corsair is a large ship containing a mix of cargo and rich passengers travelling to The City of Paths, most unaffiliated with the Duke entirely and are diplomats or well-to-dos of the Shogun. Cormack is not sure what the party will find on the ship, but they should be prepared for anything, as the prisoner was extracted from the mana refinery, so other things in the cargo area may come from that region too.

###### The Boarding
>The Nightjar flies fast and sure under the command of Sydney, and soon the Golden Goose can be seen in the distance, flying much slower in the sky below. Just when it seems that you are getting too close for nobody to notice, you see the Nightjar’s structure flicker for a moment. You realize that the cloaking spell must have been activated.
>Cormack gives you each a special hook crackling with magical energy, and smiles reassuringly. Before you can ask any more questions, a cannon on the side of the ship fires what looks like a small device onto the hull of the Golden Goose, immediately creating a shimmering line of blue light between the two ships.
>“Go! We don’t have a lot of time before we turn visible again. See you up above in a couple hours!” says Cormack, nudging you towards the zipline.

**How does this work?** 
Each party member simply has to touch the line with their hook and they will be enveloped in the same light and propelled down.

> *You land on a small platform underneath the airship, clearly the back entrance to the cargo area. In front of you you notice a sliding door without a handle, a small panel made of black glass to the side of it. As you get near, the black panel flickers and 9 digits appear on it in green light with 5 empty bars denoting a potential code. Once you are all there, the magical anchor detaches itself and disappears from view in a few seconds.*

**The Outside Door**
The party can use the universal key to open the door by simply placing the two in contact. If they do so, the wheels on the rod start spinning slowly in different directions until they stop, just as the numbers on the panel start disappearing one by one. After it goes black, the panel shuts down and the door opens.

Alternatively, the party can enter the correct combination: **12345**. The same key can be used on the safe later in the adventure.

**The Inside Door**
The door leads to a small room where Grum can be seen sleeping on a chair (possibly with a stuffed snarl nearby, if he won or was given one). On the other side of this small room, another sliding door leads further inside the airship, but is currently closed. A similar panel from the one the party encountered earlier is near the door, but this one has a big number 1 on it instead of a combination lock. Grum will be woken up by any very loud noise.

Sneaking around without waking Grum is relatively simple and doesn't require a Check. If anyone tries to search him, a Deftness check is enough to grab his keycharm, a small glass square with the number 1 on it that can open the door if held near the panel.

###### The Cargo Hold
> *As you move past the door, you enter a large square room full of cages of all sizes, made of what looks like a magical force field in the shape of a cube emanating from the floor.* 
> *Your view is immediately captured by a very large cage in the middle of the room containing a large horned and scaly, similar to a weirdly mutated largzard that stands on its front arms, that immediately wakes up and starts looking at you through the force field.* 
> *Other smaller cages are scattered about this room, all containing strange animals? monstrosities? of all sizes. There are no windows in this room, but bright light emanating from two long strips along the sides of the ceiling illuminates it.*

**Room Layout**
BREAK!!'s combat uniquely allows for throwing together a battlemap on-the-fly with its area-based system. If you find an applicable map that you want to use (this includes the remainder of the module) then absolutely go for it! However, do not feel pressured or that things will lack if you don't.

The room is rectangular and dominated by a large cage right in the middle, which held the largzard. There are other smaller cages all around containing different animals and monsters. All cages have an individual switch that can deactivate their force field next to them.

I would break down the room into 4 Areas next to each other, with the party starting on the leftmost side and the largzard starting at the third area in. This allows range characters to have a buffer while melee characters can go charging in. Of course, you can add or remove Areas dynamically depending on how things go - meaning if they run back into the previous room.

Two more cages are of particular interest: a large one containing a **Giant Mana Beetle** (Jumbug, pg. 191) and a smaller one containing a **Shock Tree Lalka** (Lalka, pg. 392). Unlike normal air or earth Lalkas, this bark-like Lalka has a buzz to it and is relatively intelligent. The Lalka is however invisible, so the cage looks empty despite the fact that the force field is up. These two cages are near the opposite side of the room from where the party enters.

**Scene**
When the players enter the coach, the **Mutated Largzard** (Largzard, pg. 192) takes notice and starts thrashing around inside the cage. The force fields starts flickering at the creature’s attacks and deactivates quickly. The largzard then engages in combat with the party.

Once the largzard goes down to below 3 Hearts or 3 Rounds pass, it runs away and crashes into the cage that contains the **Giant Mana Beetle** that will then join the combat by moving in a straight line towards the bulk of the party. The beetle intends to flee the room, so if left alone it will simply cower in a corner on the opposite side of the largzard.

The largzard can be calmed down, and will stop attacking once low on health. This does not have to be a fight to the death. It is meant to be a combat encounter, so it’s good not to simply allow an Aura check, but appropriate abilities or trying that same check after some combat and maybe healing the largzard of its wounds could be an appropriate way to stop it. 

Other cages may be opened and contain all sorts of mutations of common creatures - like Skrees, Bumpos, etc. The party may use spells or abilities to get them to join the fight, in which case either use whatever creature statblock is most relevant to your choice (Pets pg. 188, Mounts pg. 191, Pack Beasts pg. 193).

The **Shock Tree Lalka** is intelligent and will call out to the players once the battle is over. It will offer help to the party as long as they open the doors for it and promise to free it. The Lalka does not have a name, but will gladly accept a name bestowed on it. 

The Lalka will shy away from combat for the rest of the session, however is happy to use its **Electroshock** ability on the next room to put all the guards to sleep. If it does that, the guards automatically fail their save. The Lalka plans to seek its freedom after the end of the session, but you may decide that it decides to stick around for the rest of the campaign.

###### The Guard Room
> *The door on the other side opens to a small room with a spiral staircase in the middle, leading up. You hear voices coming from the room above, and you can just barely see a few guards playing cards around a table. They have not noticed you yet.*

**How many guards?**
Adjust the number of guards to be equal to the party. The guards are not looking at the staircase the party is entering from but would be alerted if anyone were to approach the table, which is between the staircase and the exit to the deck of the ship.

**Scene**
These guards will fight and try and knock out the players if alerted. They all have Level 1 Keycharms and are wearing uniforms with the Cavalier emblem on it. 

Inside a cabinet near the table, the party can find general medicinal supplies and a bottles of the world-famous Merona Pop, one for each party member. They act as **Basic Potions** (pg. 177). There's potential here to add in some **Treats** or **Booster Cakes** here if you want to encourage Negotiation tactics.

Another cabinet contains 2 glass marbles that can be used to form an **thick fog cloud** in an area. The bead can be thrown up to 2 Areas away in combat and cause the targeted Area to be Obscured (pg. 251) for 6 Rounds (or 1 minute outside of combat).

Lastly, this room contains a large safe that can be opened through another combination panel. The combination is with Rufo (see the next section) but the party can use the universal key if it still has a charge.

A sliding door can be opened with a Level 1 Keycharm and leads to the deck of the ship.

**What's in the Safe?**
3 minor magical items. 
- The original 5E module suggested using their list of 100 magical items and rolling for it. The items would need to be adjusted for BREAK!! but I felt I should include it here regardless: https://www.dmsguild.com/product/290611/Wouters-Worldly-Wunderkammer.
- A fun, though non-magical, list of 100 items that might inspire creative play: https://udan-adan.blogspot.com/2018/02/when-all-you-have-is-hammer-item-based.html?m=1.
- Alternatively you could find another list, choose random things from the Gear list (if you don't mind them transitioning into a campaign!), or whatever weapons your party wants.

Various gemstones, coins and valuable items for a total value of 5 Gems. 

1 Backpack (pg. 173).

###### The Open Air Restaurant
> *Round tables are nicely set on this part of the deck, and you see waiters constantly coming in and out of a small building to one side of the ship that has a large open counter to order food from. Plenty of well-dressed passengers are sitting at the table, all but one completely full. A few guards are also apparently on break, and you notice at one table next to the kitchen sits an older officer wearing a particularly elaborate uniform.* 
> *Further down on the deck you see a narrow building with a glass roof and a sign that says ‘containment facility’ over another sliding door.*

If the party tries to order they are told that there is an hour’s wait for food as the restaurant is severely
understaffed. Interactions with the passengers can be improvised, and since some guards are sitting at the table having a break, they wouldn’t rouse suspicions if they mingle with civilians. Some conversation topics could be these civilians/nobles complaining about petty riots in the Holy Isle cities, how hard it is with the recent increased trade tariffs, how nice it is that the pirates around Night Haven no longer raid merchant ships...

The door to the containment facility can be opened with a keycharm, but as the panel shows it requires a Level 2 one. If the party tries to wander off to other parts of the ship, guards stop them and tell them that they are not assigned to these areas, and should either go back below deck or get something from the restaurant.

There are 3 **elite guards** sitting at the table with **Rufo**, the Promethean officer that is in charge of this transport operation. Rufo has a Level 2 Keycharm as well as a note with the combination to the safe (it’s **34521**).
- Elite guards are essentially buffed Crustals. They have 3 Hearts and +2 Attack bonus instead, and have the Passion's Fire ability (pg. 43) from the Battle Princess Calling.
- Rufo uses the Proudhound Sellsword statblock (pg. 402), which is pretty strong. Depending on the group composition and level you decide, you should adjust his Defense/Attack/Hearts as needed.

If a fight breaks here a lot of guards join, so many that the party may be overwhelmed and taken prisoner. They are then taken into the containment facility and imprisoned in a force cage (see next section).

**Getting a Level 2 Keycharm**
The party can either lure Rufo over to the guards room, pickpocket him, or convince the waiters to give them food to deliver to the containment facility.

The head chef also has a Level 2 keycharm, and could be convinced to part with it, as the staff is too busy to deliver food to the containment facility.

###### The Containment Facility
> This narrow room is lit from above, as the ceiling appears to be made of glass. A force field is activated at the end of the room, emanating from the floor. Inside the cage a Bio-Mechanoid sits in silence as a man outside of it talks to them in harsh tones.
Two large scaly drakes, one blue and one green, are looking at the prisoner while standing at the side of the man, who is holding a polished metal cane.
You notice a metal grid on the floor, small element gems emitting a faint blue light at its nodes.

![[Vincent.png|350]]
> *Vincent Thornbeauty, Head Curator of the Black Glove Cavaliers
> Art (relates to NSFW URLs): https://www.pinterest.jp/pin/330451691398377263/

**Description/Layout**
The interior of this narrow room is 15 feet wide and 60 feet long. The man is Vincent Thornbeauty, the Head Curator of the Black Glove Cavaliers and in charge of information extraction and research into the Hall of Truths. Alongside him are 1-2 Snarls (pg. 436), depending on the party's power.

For combat, I'd recommend the following battlemap of Areas and starter placements:
![[ContainmentBattlemap.png]]

**If the party comes into the room without suspicion raised above deck**:
They'll have a chance to speak with Vincent - to whatever end they see. It is basically impossible that Vincent would just release the Bio-mechanoid out of any moral plea, but there is a possibility that he could be convinced for some incredible personal benefit.
- This part can be left up to your whims and the backgrounds of the party. BREAK!! can lean heavily into the Negotiation and social aspect, so this is a potential avenue for resolution outside of combat.
- One such angle might be to convince Vincent to swap to the Helical Research Archive's side in exchange for a powerful position at the Facility and resources for his personal endeavors. How? Well, let the party handle that and a Negotiation check.

**If the party comes into the room 'hot':**
This situation occurs after, say, after a combat on the deck, are imprisoned in a force cage after being arrested, or some other more aggressive situation. In these cases, combat is likely to occur just straight up. Vincent will stand back, poised, and let his Snarls engage directly in combat. As they jump in, he'll pull a crystal controller out of his pocket to first lock the door behind the party. Combat begins. 

Vincent takes on the statblock of a **Battle Butler** (pg. 390). His primary strategy on his turn (if he is not engaged with someone actively) is to manipulate the gems on the floor and create mana walls that block party members from each other; hopefully to let the Snarls face the party one-by-one.

As an Action, Vincent can rearrange the walls coming from the floors. One Area of Vincent's choice becomes fully Isolated (pg. 250), such that normal Movement cannot make it into the Area. The trick is that these walls are shatterable, starting with 1 Heart and a low Defense rating of 10 which increases by 5 on subsequent Rounds.

The prisoner's force cage (and potentially the one that the party is in if they were arrested) has 1 Heart and a Defense Rating of 20. If the prisoner joins the fight at any point, they will either provide Attack Assists to anyone attacking Vincent or Defend themselves if the battle isn't looking good. They use the **Custrel** statblock (pg. 186) but have no weapon on them.

The glass ceiling can be opened via a switch on the other end of the room. It could also be broken if attacked (Defense Rating 15, 1 Heart for each Area). Once the ceiling is open, the party can flee to the skies above, to be later safely collected by the Cloudstriders.

**Siding with Night Haven**
If Vincent starts losing the fight, he will offer the party a chance to work for the Cavaliers, promising they will be pardoned and handsomely rewarded. Provided they have not killed any guards so far, they can get this opportunity.

The session could end here in this case, and this can be the start of a campaign that will see the the party working for the Cavaliers/the Duke of Red Roses. Think about how the Cloudstriders and the Helical Research Archive would react to this choice, and consider incorporating them in the campaign as rival factions later on.

###### The Prisoner
The prisoner is a Bio-Mechanoid named M0CH-3 (or Mochi) that has spent the last who-knows how long deactivated in that Gleysian mana refinery following the Sundering. They are relieved to have been extracted, but worried at the same time what their fate new will be with their 'liberators'. 

Depending on the knowledge the party knows (of QU-66's plans or Helical), the reaction might swing a few different ways:
- If your party is honest about the Helical's plan for the Hall of Truths, they'll be amenable and believe its a debt to repay.
- If your party is horrible at a convincing argument or maybe even the special case one of the party members has the Dark Demeanor Quirk (pg. 137), you could potentially even make it a Negotiation to convince them to not try and escape...in some way.
- They might also be or feign ignorance, in which case MOCH-3 will continue being wary but at the very least eager to leave the Crimson Corsair.

#### Epilogue - Turning this Adventure into a Campaign
If this is the first adventure of a campaign and the party has not accepted Vincent’s offer, they can be asked by Cormack to either join the Cloudstriders outright or do some more contracting work for them. A future mission for the Cloudstriders may then bring the group to a place where something interesting will happen!

There is the potential for the party to be chosen to actually be a part in finding the Hall of Truths with help from QU-66 and MOCH-3. This could be a daring mission into the Sunken Isles, fighting off ancient technology and sea creatures.

There are plenty of interesting directions to take and hopefully this adventure module can be the starting point to a solidly built crew and world at the whims of an airship!
