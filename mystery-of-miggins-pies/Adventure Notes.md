#### **An introductory adventure for ~~D&D 5th Edition~~ BREAK!!**
**NOTE:** This is a relatively straight adaptation of the one-shot The Goblins and the Pie, available here: https://burnafterrunningrpg.com/2018/01/08/the-goblins-and-the-pie-shop-a-1st-level-dd-adventure/ by author https://burnafterrunningrpg.com/author/guyeatsfood/. I take no credit for the characters/story; I merely expanded the mechanics and flavor to the BREAK!! system and world. Please support the original author. As well, this is an unofficial BREAK!! work and is not affiliated with the original creators. All art used within is not mine, and I have tried to link the true base source where possible. 

Designed as a simple adventure for BREAK!!, leveraging the use of mechanics like Negotiation, Journey, Exploration, Combat, and Roleplay. It assumes some knowledge of these mechanics from the GM, and they are not explained in-depth in this document. It is built in mind for 2-4 Rank 2 Adventurers, but can be scaled easily depending (just add more Hearts or Adversaries). It is intended to take 2-4 hours depending on storytelling speed/roleplay, but some scenes can be skipped/streamlined to save on time if needed.

**The Hook:** Mrs Miggins’ pie shop is the first place any self-respecting adventurer would head to on their way out to seek their fortune in the world... her pies' delicious meat and flaky crust are the talk of every surrounding Wistful Dark tavern, and many emboldened ventures into the wilderness have started here. Naturally, as you venture into the Murk, you’d stop here first... but when Mundymutts have stolen her secret spice mix, you must rush to Mrs. Miggins’ aid so that adventurers will be sustained.

**Background – DM’s Eyes Only**: Symon “The Pieman” has a pie shop in town, and he’s brutally jealous of Mrs. Miggins’ success. He uses the same alchemist to ward his own shop – so once he learned how to bypass the magical wardings, he sent his goons in to steal her secret spice recipe. He then paid Holg the Herbalist to break in and kick about the shop the following day to cover up the theft and make it look like a random Mundymutt raid.

#### **Village of Roost:** 
Set just on the outside of a swampy portion of the Murk in the Wistful Dark, Roost is a stilt-raised cliffside shantytown, comprised primarily of the Alchemists Guild, Mrs. Miggins' pie shop, and The White Lion Tavern. Oh...and Symon's "pie shop". It is a mishmash of species and cultures, come here as a hub to tackle or study the Murk from.

#### **Characters of Note**:
**Mrs. Miggins':** An Elf of unknown age who has been making pies for as long as anyone can remember here. They've been going through a tattoo-punk phase of late. Blunt but poppy. They run a humble yet cozy nature-based pie shop/cafe in the village of Roost.

**Symon "The Pieman":** A person of unknown species due to the fact they are constantly clad in regal armor adorned with standard bakers attire. Presents as fancy and reputable, however it is clear that the baking skills and passion are less than adequate. Some suspect he comes from a royal line...whether they are bakers or not is unknown. Regardless, he speaks dramatically.

**Holg the Herbalist:** An older Gruun herbalist who lives just a bit into the Murk, occasionally trekking out to Roost to exchange cautionary tales and remedies. Big, big fan of Miggins' pies. A generally gentle soul trying to help all folk but does not take kindly to being pushed around.

**Crawford Ellison:** A uptight, posh and studious Chib sage that leads the Alchemists Guild, a once nomadic guild turned recently stationary as Roost is the perfect hub outside the Murk to study. Offers protectionary services to the townsfolks in terms of attire or household warding.

#### **Scene 0: Pre-Set Up**
Allow the players to choose characters and introduce them briefly. Explain the starting situation to the players. In brief:
- They have decided to seek their fortune in the Murk, for the reasons determined previously
- They are relatively fresh adventurers, having done some tasks together already.
- It is traditional amongst new adventurers to call at Mrs. Miggins’ Pie Shop, on the edge of the forest, for some fortifying snacks to take with them on their way in.
- The forest is dangerous in the center, but at its boundaries it is less dangerous. However, there are still the Mundymutts gang called the Murk Mutts, Skelemen patrols of some deeper Skele-Monarch, and occasional horrors wandering around it.

The PCs have some background already, but spend a few minutes asking each of them one of
the questions from the list below.
- Why are you venturing into the Murk? What great riches await you there?
- What is said to guard these riches?
- What has made you leave your comfortable home to take up a life of adventure?
- (insert name), you have a mentor, a veteran adventurer. Who is he and what has he told you of Mrs Miggins pie shop?
- (insert name), a friend of yours growing up was Mrs Miggins’ grandson. What pie filling did he recommend that you just had to try?
- (insert name), you’re not sure you even like pies. You had one of Symon the Pieman’s pies back in the village and it made you sick. What have the others done to convince you to stop at Mrs Miggins’?

As the players answer these questions, make brief notes of them – if you can, on a big piece
of paper in the middle of the table so that all the players can see it. If you can incorporate
these answers into the game as it plays, so much the better – and encourage the players to
do so as well!

#### **Scene 1: Mrs Miggins’**
> Suggested map: https://2minutetabletop.com/bakery-everyday-day-16x22/

As they approach the Pie Shop, a cozy stone shop from which you would normally
expect the smell of delicious baking, it is early in the Party's day and something is clearly wrong. The door hangs ajar from its hinges and the gates to the cottage garden appear to have been torn from their hinges. There are signs of a scuffle inside, and as they approach cautiously, they discover a group of Mundymutts engaged in ransacking the place.
*Combat Details*: There are three punk-themed Mundymutts, Elg, Melg, and Thom. They are Delinquent Goons (DB). They are extremely cowardly – they will try to run as soon as one or two of their members goes down. They generally speak in Dark Tongue unless taunting the Party. Of course, the PCs may well decide to give chase, which will allow them to work out who sent them.
*Treasure*: The Mundymutts carry only loose change – they carry 10 Stones each. Thom has a Small Mechanical Missile Weapon, and Elg and Melg have Shoddy Standard Weapons.

Mrs Miggins is tied up, badly injured, groggy and uncommunicative. To converse and receive pies, she requires some form of stabilization (use of a Physicians' Kit, the Healing Hands Ability, a Basic Potion, etc.). If aided, she says that she came down this morning to find the Mundymutts rooting around. She has freshly paid-up magical wards from the Alchemist’s Guild in town, so she was surprised to see them, but they quickly overwhelmed her. There’s no way they could have bypassed those wards – she often finds drunken adventurers trying to sneak in and steal pies, and the wards always knock them out cold.

Any surviving Mundymutts can be easily persuaded (via Negotiation with a free Minor Bonus) to surrender what information they know. They were tipped off by Holg the Herbalist to raid the shop, and told there would be no magical defences. There weren’t, and the door was unlocked, which they thought was unusual. Holg oftens throws good jobs to their tribe (the Murk Mutts) in return for odd jobs and help with distracting adventurers. He’s a herbalist who lives not far from here on the edge of the forest. Mrs Miggins knows him as a regular customer, and is very upset if she learns that he has had any hand in the raid. She doubts that he is skilled enough to remove her magical protections. 

Mrs Miggins is in shock when it emerges that her secret spice mix has also been stolen – the
Mundymutts know nothing about it, but when she checks her cupboards it’s nowhere to be seen. She offhandedly remarks that, while she has no competitors because her product is so good, **Symon “the Pie Man”** in the village would dearly love to get his hands on her spice formula, and he has been visiting recently asking her about what goes into it – she never reveals anything, and has told him he will just have to devise his own formula! She of course begs the PCs to help her recover the secret spices; she can offer lifetime credit at her pie shop, 1 Gem, and also 2 Vitality Fizz [Basic Potions] that they can take with them now if they agree to help.
- She has slim pickings left after they ransacked the place, but she notes that she has a few tucked away. Offers one pie per PC, up to GM whether to select specific Attributes or have it at random.

A really thorough search of Mrs Miggins’ spice cupboard reveals a scrap of black velvet that
has been caught on the side of the wall – and which certainly doesn’t belong to any Mundymutts. From this point, the players may decide to investigate their leads in whatever order the choose – they can visit the Alchemist’s Guild (scene 2), or head over to Holg’s dwelling (scene 3). Either of these may lead them to scene 4 or to the final confrontation in scene 5. 
- Ask if there are any preparations desired before heading into the Murk, that while safe-ish on the outskirts, has pockets of danger.
- Alchemists Guild would have knowledge on the types of danger in the forest (e.g. Anti-Hazard suit to avoid everything, or Rebreather to avoid siphoning spores).

#### **Scene 2: The Alchemists’ Guild**

The Alchemists Guild sits on the edge of town, and it is straightforward to get an
appointment with Crawford Ellison, the wispy-bearded sage who set up Mrs Miggins wards.
- If persuaded (Negotiation, boosted by example factors below) he will reveal that they are standard-issue wards, given to regular business customers, and, as they check his records, that the wards only appear to be changed weekly – so that a customer who had the wards installed in the same week could in theory bypass them. 
	- Negotiation bonus: Booster Cake of Insight (Focusberry flavored)
	- Negotiation bonus: Working on a brutal deadline at the moment, will help in exchange for contracting services later, etc.
- If Crawford refuses to talk to them (failed Negotiation) they can see the warding roster and invoices sat in the back office of the Guild - a Deftness Check is enough to find them by stealth and discover the same information.
	- If caught: Grit Check, failure equals Ballooned condition which they roll the PC out of their workshop with a huff and very obviously put up their own wards.

The customers from the same week include Rezzik the Half-Gruun’s Wagon company, The
White Lion public tavern, and **Symon “the Pie Man”** for his pie shop at the edge of town...
again, if Crawford is friendly he will reveal that Symon still hasn’t paid for his wards, as he
said he had a big business venture coming up which would mean he could pay them off
easily. He has also asked for another job to be completed, and they are currently debating
whether to ask for the money up front this time – for a small shack further into the forest (“A
godforsaken place – that surely can’t be his next business venture, unless he’s setting up
some sort of Mundymutt mercenary company haha!”). 
- A sketched map to this shack is held with the other files for the wards, which Crawford will share with the PCs if he is friendly.

#### **Scene 3: Holg the Gruun**

Travelling to Holg's shack takes a day's worth of Travel. For every Journey Check made, all Players must make an Aura Check or they take a level of Fatigue as the flora of the Murk drains their energy. This is avoided by being a Bio-Mechanoid, wearing a Rebreather, or wearing an Anti-Hazard Suit.

Holg lives in a isolated, tumbledown cottage deeper into the woods. He’s a solitary herbalist,
and while he has no great love for adventurers, he’s no fool. He has had a bad feeling about
organizing the Mundymutts to raid Mrs Miggins ever since he was party to it, and is keen to try
and make amends so he can enjoy her delicious pies again. Holg isn’t easy to persuade, but
a Negotiation will be enough to make him share what he knows, or any show of force that shows him the PCs mean business. Once this happens he will reveal that Symon used him as a go-between to get the Mundymutts to ransack the shop.
*Combat Details:* Holg takes the stats of a [Mushdoom](https://breakrpg.blogspot.com/2023/09/freebie-funguy-and-mushdoom-adversaries.html), who flavors the Telepathic Spores Ability as releasing some herbal bottle of spores. He surrenders as soon as the combat turns against him - which refers to getting him to, or below, 2 Hearts.

What Holg knows:
- Symon just said that the magical protections would be down for the day, and asked that Holg go and ransack the place. Holg is quite fond of Mrs Miggins, so he didn’t go himself, but he got the Murk Mutts to go, on the condition they didn’t hurt her
- He knows nothing about the secret spice mix, or even that Symon’s men had raided the shop previously
- He can give them directions to the shack that Symon has set up in the forest, and everyone knows where the Symon “the Pie Man”’s shop is

Miscellaneous:
- If any PC is Jellyfied, he'll offer them a remedy as a show of good faith.
- In exchange for a pie, he'll give them 2 doses of the Jellyfied remedy if they have to go to the Shack still.

#### **Scene 4: The Shack in the Forest**
Travelling to the Shack requires 2 days of Travel from either Holg's or Roost. Per Journey Check made, all Players must make a Grit Check or become Jellyfied as strange bioluminescent spores touch their skin. This is avoided by being a Bio-Mechanoid or wearing an Anti-Hazard Suit.

A eerie, falling down shack some ways into the Murk sits alone on an island over a shallow knee-high pond. Twisted roots reach for the canopy and occasional calls of some horrid beast can be heard stalking the outskirts. The door is ajar slightly, either by mold or someone it is unknown. On the door, it simply reads 'Bear Trap, beware.'
- If any Player is Jellyfied, the pond counts as Harmful Terrain to them. Finding some means of safely traversing the water is needed.

Inside the door is a staircase leading down to an underground entry hallway, now more fortified by stone. A solitary and clearly visible bear trap is in the middle of the room, stood in front of a heavy stone door with a built in lock. It is possible to open the door with the right Gear or creative Ability Usage.

The real trap in the room is a bear-like creature that drops from the ceiling if a pressure plate in the room is set off. The bear-like creature takes the stats of a Chompa (pg. 368). Trap details:
- Insight Check (or Cautious Movement) to detect the pressure plate in the room.
- If not seen, requires a Deftness Check to approach the door without setting it off. 
- If set off, the ceiling above rumbles open as the bear-thing drops from the ceiling with a large stone key around its neck.

Past this door, Symon has set this up as a secret laboratory to try and duplicate the results of his theft. The shack is lined with herbs and spices, and different crust mixtures sit in an ice-box alongside packets of Mrs Miggins’ pies. Hidden away in the shelves (Insight Check or relevant Abilities) is Mrs Miggins’ secret mix, with the label half-peeled off.

#### **Scene 5: Symon “the Pieman”’s Shop**
> Suggested map: https://www.patreon.com/DarkestMaps/shop/alchemy-shop-20x20-16-variants-306856

Symon’s shop is freshly painted anew and gorgeous, but the aroma of pastry that comes from it is stale, and the meat in his pie fillings is under-seasoned. His shelves groan with unsold pies – truth  be told, Symon is not a gifted baker, and unless he is able to successfully duplicate Mrs Miggins’ spice mix, it is unlikely that his business will survive.

If the PCs arrive here without solid proof that Symon is implicated in this, he will present himself as a reputable businessman and tell them that the attack on Mrs Miggins is a result
of random Mundymutt raids. Only the evidence of the secret spice mix (if they have recovered it from the shack), or compelling evidence like the torn black velvet, will force him into a  confrontation, where he will attempt to silence the PCs.
*Combat*: Symon takes the stats of a Werebear (DB). Depending on the Party, you can include his side hound Gnash, a Snarl (pg. 436).
*Treasure*: Symon and his men carry 10 Coins and 50 Stones. Symon has an Advanced Potion that heals 2 Hearts (which he drinks if he has to).

He fights to the death as he realizes his entire business empire is at risk, peppering the battle with references to Mrs Miggins’ terrible pies and how she only made her fortune serving dishonest adventurers. He vaguely comments on how she stole his family's recipe generations back and he's been tracking her down as his knighted life goal.

#### **Conclusion:**
Once dispatched, the town guards will be certain to arrive and take Symon and his men to
be imprisoned and tried by the village magistrate. Having rescued the secret spice mix, it is probably time for the PCs to return to Mrs Miggins where she will be fulsome with her praise
and generous with her pies!
